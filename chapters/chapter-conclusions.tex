\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}

The work presented here has combined different approaches of contemporary 
ecological questions. Regarding microbial diversity, on the global scale the available 
knowledge was explored using literature and data mining. On the local scale
the soil microbial diversity of Crete was deciphered. Literature and data mining 
methodologies are also very useful to rescue historical biodiversity data which are
indispensable. This was demonstrated through the DECO workflow, a collection
of tools and standards aiming to assist the curators' process. From the comparison
of such tools it became clear that human curation is a transversal undertaking in all steps.
Expert curation was applied for the compilation of historical and contemporary
literature along with specimens from NHMC for the endemic Cretan arthropods occurrences.
After the compilation of the dataset it became clear that a conservation analysis
was a priority because the majority of species was predicted as threatened.
Nevertheless, the investigation of the soil dwelling arthropods with the soil microbial diversity
and plants is crucial for soil functioning. 

While analysing the ISD Crete 2016 the sampling replicability was put into action with a 
new sampling in July of 2022.
Using the same protocols and locations, 29 people from HCMR, NHMC, UOC Biology
Department and citizen scientists where split in 10 teams and went sampling. 
The goal of this sampling was to collect a second time point of the same locations
to decipher the metagenomic content of soil. This was a voluntary work supported 
by the SUPP GEN project of HCMR. The DNA extraction and shipment was carried out 
by HCMR and sequencing by the Joint Genome Initiative. DNA extracted by the 72 locations 
is going to be sequenced using deep shotgun sequencing. This is one of the few large scale metagenomic soil projects in
Europe \parencite{nayfach2021a-genomic, ma2023a-genomic}. Currently, 
the ambitious \href{https://www.embl.org/about/info/trec/}{TREC project} is
ongoing aiming to fill this gap with.

There is a wealth of available data and tools as demonstrated in 
multiple chapters in this PhD. Yet the basic conceptual challenges remain. 
Some of these can be formulated as : What are the causes of ecosystem collapse?
What is needed for a sustainable future?
How will climate warming change life on Earth?
These clear questions require what is called scientific transculturalism,
the process of integration of the three culturesâ€”variance, coarse-graining, and exactitude \parencite{Enquist_2024}.
These cultures can be vaguely described as natural history, numerical ecology and complex systems ecology, respectively.
An important step to bring these cultures together is communication and openness across scientists.
These gaps must be eliminated soon to reach predictive ecology goals \parencite{mouquet_review_2015}.

The exemplary collaboration of science, enterprise and society was
illustrated during the pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020 \parencite{ioannidis2021the-rapid,lee2021scientific}. 
This level of synergy is needed to tackle the environmental issues
as well, like sustainable agriculture. Soil health,
and one health in general, is key to avoid the disastrous projections of
current practices in agriculture and industries \parencite{banerjee2023Soil}.
More than 60\% of
soils in Europe are considered unhealthy leading to erosion, degradation, contamination,
and disruption of global nutrient cycles \parencite{commission2020caring}.
Economically, it is estimated that due to soil degradation about 50 billion euro per year
are lost in the European Union. 
Yet, soil, the foundation of 
terrestrial ecosystems, is not protected with legislation across Europe.
Since 2020, after devastating realisations about soil, the European Parliament 
is in the process of structuring a soil monitoring and resilience law to achieve 
the goal of having healthy soils by 2050. As of writing this Thesis, the EU 
parliament has just voted the \href{https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2024)757627}{soil monitoring law}
while Trialoge, Second reading and Adoption steps are still in progress to make it final.

Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) data and methods
are the only way for science to assist the society and convince stakeholders for action. 
This Thesis, is doing exactly that using Crete as a model of application. Across the chapters it is shown how 
integrating multiple types of data can help identify signals of health concerns and 
pressured ecosystems.
