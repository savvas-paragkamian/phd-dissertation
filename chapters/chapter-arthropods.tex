Crete data since 19th century. 

To being able to study first they have to be conserved.

protected areas, IUCN assessments and hotspots and Key Biodiversity Areas


%% need to modify
Hotspot definitions vary from quantitative methods to experts opinions and curation.
In quantitative methods, grid size and shape influences the determination of
the areas of interest such as hotspots and key biodiversity areas \parencite{hurlbert2007species,nhancale2011the-influence}.
Choosing the size of the grid is not trivial \parencite{mo2019influences} and is dependent
on the conservation goals \parencite{margules2000systematic}. In the past decade,
there have been major advances for conservation standards, guidelines,
frameworks and tools available to be put into action \parencite{bongaarts2019ipbes}.


%%%%% old
Numbering approximately 7,000 species [extrapolated from Fauna Europaea
\parencite{jong2014fauna} and \textcite{legakis2018}], the Arthropods of Crete, Greece,
have been studied for almost two centuries \parencite{Anastasiou2018Tenebrionid}.
Only 135 of these species (1.9\%) have been assessed in IUCN Red List as of
this publication, making Arthropods the third most evaluated group of the
island, behind vascular plants (291) and land mollusks (165).

Habitat loss and degradation occurs throughout Crete as a result of urban,
agricultural and touristic development. This is a major issue since habitat
loss is a major threat in Europe for many Arthropod groups,
e.g. Butterflies \parencite{VanSwaaycommission2010european}, Bees \parencite{nieto2014},
Orthoptera \parencite{hochkirch2016} and Saproxylic Beetles \parencite{Calix_2018}.
Climate change is predicted to induce scarcer yet more intense precipitation,
increase of drought locally \parencite{koutroulis2011spatiotemporal} and shrinkage as well as
possible shifts to the rainfall period \parencite{koutroulis2013impact}. Groups
associated with fresh water could be deeply impacted from the locally increased
drought and the increase in need of water for irrigation and domestic use,
e.g. Odonata \parencite{kalkman2010}, which has become harsher due to the
increase of agriculture and land use \parencite{tzanakakis2020challenges}. Stock raising
(sheep and goats) has always been an important aspect of Cretan life and
economy \parencite{rackham1996the-making}. Overgrazing impacts severely soil erosion,
soil moisture and vegetation \parencite{kosmas2015exploring,orestis2015exploring}. All the
above contribute to a worrying trend for Crete, i.e. the higher percentage of
Threatened endemic Arthropods when compared with the respective European
groups.

The bibliography and the NHMC collection was curated to assemble taxa
occurrences. The bibliography used
contains both historical and contemporary published material.
Using over 100 publications (as of 2020) and 733 NHMC sampling events
(\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10635645}{data online availability}), a dataset of 343 taxa (species and subspecies) was assembled,
with 4,924 records across 1,569 distinct sites of Crete. The taxa
are distributed to eleven orders, with Coleoptera having the most taxa (206)
and Chilopoda and Scorpiones the least (two).
Based on the criteria described in \textcite{bolanakis2024} the data resulted in the
following orders:
Araneae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera (Chrysididae, Formicidae, Symphyta), Lepidoptera (Geometridae), Odonata, Orthoptera, Scorpiones and Trichoptera.


In this study I aim to a) identify cretan arthropods available information
b) compare with the endemics of Crete
c) their relation with the anthropogenic pressures in these sites.
To do so, I assembled the accumulated knowledge of 
online databases.


% METHODS
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:arthropods-method}
   

    \subsection{Taxa distributions}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-eoo-aoo}
Retrieval and compilation of information on arthropod species' taxonomy,
global distributions, and IUCN status was performed using public databases.
The dataset of endemic species assessments from a TSV file and several IUCN Red
List datasets for Greece, endemic Greek species, Europe, and the world.

Taxa from IUCN that appear in Crete were downloaded from the website \parencite{iucn2024}. IUCN provides the 
interactive maps selection functionality. 
%It begins by loading necessary libraries such as sf, tidyverse, readxl, rredlist, taxize, units, and vegan. 
For each Red List dataset, it processes the data to identify threatened species
(those categorized as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable), groups
them by taxonomic order and threat status, and adds a source identifier.
These processed datasets are combined into a single dataset of threatened species, which is saved to a TSV file.
The script also filters out all arthropod species from the IUCN Red Listr
datasets, saves this information to a TSV file, and retrieves their GBIF IDs,
although the time-consuming classification process is commented out.
Additionally, the script resolves species names using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy
and retrieves GBIF IDs for the endemic species, identifying and handling species
without GBIF IDs separately. It performs classification for the species using
GBIF data, merges this with the original endemic species data, and saves the
final dataset with taxonomic information to a TSV file.

The aoo overlap function is part of the IUCN assessment process for arthropods
under Criterion B, which focuses on the Area of Occupancy (AOO) and its overlap
with protected areas. This function takes in the shapefiles of species' AOO,
a baseline map (Crete), a shapefile of overlap areas (protected areas and land use maps),
Initially, each species' AOO is calculated, converting the data to a spatial feature
and calculating its area in square kilometers. It computes the intersection of
the AOO with protected areas, determines the overlapping area, and stores the
species' name, AOO area, and overlap area. Maps are also generated for each
species that depict the AOO and its overlap with protected areas.

The eoo calculation function is designed to calculate the Extent of Occurrence (EOO),
the number of sites and the overlap with a provided area.
The EOO for a single species is calculated if there are more than three occurrences.
EOO is the convex hull of the species' occurrences, it is checked if the EOO is valid
polygon and calculates its area in square kilometers. The function computes the intersection of the EOO with protected areas and calculates the overlapping area.
One figure for each species is also produced for more thorough assessments.
Together, these functions provide a comprehensive method for calculating and
assessing the AOO and EOO of arthropods, including their overlaps with protected
areas, as part of the IUCN assessment process. This approach allows for detailed
spatial analysis and visualization, facilitating the conservation status evaluation of arthropod species.


    \subsection{Grid assay}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-ehs-kbas}
Assessments of hotspots of endemic and threatened species of Cretan arthropods
using various grid sizes, including 1, 4, 8, and 10 square kilometers, and
employs adaptive resolution techniques such as quadtree. Initially, it loads
essential data, including endemic species occurrences, Cretan shapefiles, and
Natura2000 areas. For each grid size, the script transforms and joins occurrence
data, calculates distinct species and sampling efforts, and assesses correlations
between species richness and sampling intensity. The 10 km grid analysis involves
spatial joins, summarizing species occurrences, and calculating sampling intensity,
followed by Pearson correlation assessment. The 1 km grid analysis similarly joins data,
identifies species occurrences, and evaluates correlation metrics.
The 4 and 8 km grids utilize manually created rasters to map occurrences and
sampling efforts, with similar summarization and correlation steps. The script
then explores adaptive resolution using quadtree, generating spatial polygons
and assessing species richness and endemism hotspots.
Finally, the results are visualized in detailed plots, showcasing hotspots
across various grid sizes and the adaptive quadtree approach, providing a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity hotspots on Crete.


In order to avoid biases concerning the grid cell size, the same
pipeline was tested with cells of different size (4 x 4, 8 x 8 and 10 x 10 km).
For the subsequent analyses we opted for the 10 x 10 km grid (see section \ref{subsec:arthropods-grids})
which is also the EEA reference grid, the standard for the reporting format
(Groups of Experts, 2017) of the Resolution No. 8 (2012) of the Standing Committee
to the Bern Convention on the Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCI).
Moreover, the EHs of the various cell sizes are aggregated in the same areas.
We made the same treatment for each of the selected groups separately.
We redefined EHs as the 10\% of the grid cells with max overlap of the orders
to check for biases towards more speciose orders (e.g. Coleoptera).

    \subsection{Land use change}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-land-use}
To examine the human pressure (change in land use, agriculture), I used the
Historic Land Dynamics Assessment (HILDA+) dataset \parencite{winkler2021global} to
estimate the change of land use the from 1998 to 2018. Furthermore, I examined
the overlap of the AOO.


    \subsection{Code}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-tools}

The coordinate reference system we used for all location data is WGS84 - EPSG:4326.

We performed the analyses using the R Statistical Software \parencite{rcoreteam},
the visualization using the ggplot2 R package \parencite{wickham_ggplot2_2016}. The figures
created are colored using the colorblind-friendly 'Okabe-Ito' palette \parencite{ichihara2008color}.
We calculated EOO and AOO using the ConR R package \parencite{dauby2017conr:} and PACA
using custom scripts. For the spatial data handling, transformations and
geometry we used the sf v1.0-14 \parencite{pebesma2018simple} and terra v1.7-55 R packages \parencite{hijmans2024terra}.
Adaptive grid is created using the quadtree R package \parencite{friend2023quadtree}.
Jaccard similarity was calculated with the vegan 2.6-4 R package \parencite{oksanen2024vegan}.
All scripts are reproducible by design and available in this 
\href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/arthropoda_assessment_crete}{GitHub repository}.

Data, scripts and results of the analysis are available and documented \href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/arthropods_assessment_crete}{here}

      \label{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}
   \end{figure}




The grid cell size 10 x 10 km is the most suitable for our study since our
dataset - being compiled from numerous different sources and sampling efforts -
is rather coarse and inhomogenous for a smaller cell size.
The unique taxa of the EHs of each grid is distributed as follows: 10 km=283,
8 km=278, 4 km=293, adaptive cells=267, with the 4km grid covering most endemic
species. The 4 km grid mostly highlighted areas known for their tourist/recreational activities,
indicating that it is more sensitive to sampling intensity.
Focusing on sampling we applied the adaptive grid size with quadtrees resulting
in 157 grids with 8 km length, 38 with 4 km and 74 with 2 km (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS5}).
This indicates the preference of larger cells for the majority of our dataset
even though a small percent of regions has higher density of sampling.
The highest overlap among all grids is between the 10 km and 8 km reaching
57\% (Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}). Finally, the 10 km grid has more taxa
per cell and is a reference grid system.
Based on our analysis and interoperability and reproducibility aims we choose
the 10 km EEA reference grid for the EHs and candidate KBAs inference.
Nevertheless, we also performed the WEGE analysis for KBAs using the adaptive
grid, yielding practically the same areas as the 10km grid minus Zakros (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-fig5}).
The same pipeline can not be done with EHs for they require a fixed cell size.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:arthropods-discussion}

    \subsection{Endemicity Hotspots}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-Endemicity-Hotspots}

Mountains host a great amount of Earth’s biodiversity, being a main driver for
the birth of species \parencite{antonelli2018geological,noroozi2018hotspots,rahbek2019building,Rahbek2019}
and a crucial frontier for their fate \parencite{steinbauer2018accelerated,urban2018escalator}.
Crete is not an exception to this trend \parencite{kougioumoutzis2020plant,trigas2013elevational}.
Our results conform to that, since the EHs are gathered primarily in the major
Cretan mountains. Lefka Ori and Dikti are the sites with the most
EHs, in agreement with studies focused on vascular plants \parencite{dimitrakopoulos2004questioning,kougioumoutzis2020plant}.
\textcite{sfenthourakis2001hotspots}, employing invertebrate groups, also recovered these mountains as EHs.

Islands are biodiversity sanctuaries \parencite{whittaker2007island}, and
so are mountains \parencite{rahbek2019humboldts}. Our work advocates for approaches that
treat islands and mountains under a holistic perspective. The combination of
the two provides a complex biogeographical interplay governing the forces of
speciation, preservation and extinction of biodiversity \parencite{steinbauer2016topography-driven}.
This synergistic effect of mountains-islands has also been recovered in other
areas such as the Balearic islands \parencite{guardiola2023are-mediterranean}.

    \subsection{Criterion B preliminary assessment}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-species-assessment-disc}

Criterion B is the widely used for Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting,carpaneto2015a-red-list},
because the majority of Arthropods taxa are missing necessary information of the other criteria (A, C, D and E).
Criterion B could overestimate the danger of Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting},
which should always be taken into consideration.

Arthropods with wider ranges that are not assessed as Threatened under
criterion B, are not necessarily Least Concern and should not be neglected.
Arthropod communities can be affected by the reduction of the abundance of
common and abundant species that offer important functions to the biocommunity.
Wide range does not guarantee high abundance (even though this is true for many
taxa) and even common species can be threatened \parencite{habel2018vanishing,klink2023disproportionate}.

The inclusion of Arthropod taxa in protected areas is often insufficient, with
Arthropods experiencing declines inside the protected areas \parencite{borges2005ranking,chowdhury2023protected,harry2019protected,rada2019protected}.
In fact, even when certain Arthropod groups are adequately included in N2K,
there are gaps and omissions \parencite{sanchez-fernandez2008are-the-endemic,verovnik2011is-the-natura}.
At a global level 75\% of Insects are not sufficiently covered by protected
areas \parencite{chowdhury2023three-quarters}. Crete stands in an intermediate position,
following the general trend of Greece’s N2K adequacy, being the best covered
area at a national level \parencite{kougioumoutzis2021plant,spiliopoulou2021the-natura}.
However, there are some clear gaps regarding certain taxa, encouraging more
locally focused conservation policies complementary to N2K. For example actions
need to be taken for KBAs that fall outside N2K like Kritsa and Zakros.

Biases towards Arthropods cause their poor coverage by protected
areas \parencite{chowdhury2023protected,damen2013protected,delso2021protected}. These
biases derive from geography, size, color and charisma \parencite{cardoso2012habitats,mammola2020towards,wang2021out-of-sight},
and even from political/economic reasons \parencite{dias-silva2021protected}. For example,
the strongest driver for a conservation program funding within the European
Union is the online popularity \parencite{mammola2020towards}. The unpopularity of
Arthropods has begun to change \parencite{wagner2021insect}, especially through citizen
science, which is a trend we should build on to properly conserve the Arthropods.

    \subsection{Human Intervention in Arthropods’ EHs}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-human-intervention-ehs}
Human activities account for almost 20\% of the EHs. The primary human activity
in the EHs is agriculture (~19.6\%). Agricultural intensification is one of the
most important drivers of Arthropods’ decline \parencite{bruhl2019biodiversity,habel2019agricultural,raven2021agricultural}.
Moreover, threats associated with agriculture are the number one threat for
Insect species inside protected areas in Europe \parencite{chowdhury2023protected}.
Nevertheless, regarding change in land use, there is a somewhat equal
transition trend from cropland to forest and vice versa inside EHs and KBAs
(Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}). This means that while some sites are being
degraded others may recover. More research within EHs and KBAs is essential in
order to quantify the impact (negative or positive) of these transitions to the
endemic Arthropods. A vast amount of cropland has been transformed to pasture
lands (Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}) which requires further examination,
since grazing has both positive [eg. on Gnaphosidae (Spiders) communities \parencite{kaltsas2019overgrazed}]
and negative effects [e.g. Carabidae (Coleoptera) \parencite{kaltsas2013ground}].
The reduction of croplands could be interpreted under the general trend of
urbanization (Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}), which nevertheless occurs
outside EHs and KBAs, but a shift towards montane areas especially under new
forms of tourism could deeply impact the sites of conservation importance.
