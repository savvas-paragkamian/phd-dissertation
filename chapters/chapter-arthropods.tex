\chapter{Cretan Endemic Arthropods: distribution, hotspots and threats}
\label{cha:arthropods}

% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:arthropods-intro}

The complex relationships between arthropods, soil microbes, and plants
form a nexus within soil functioning, each group contributing significantly to
overall ecosystem health \parencite{rentao2023soil, insects11010054}.
Arthropods, encompassing a vast diversity of soil-dwelling species,
play a key role in regulating soil microbial communities, nutrient cycling, and
plant growth \parencite{COLEMAN2024131}.
They have an estimated biomass of
approximately 300 million metric tons, forming an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems \parencite{milo-arthropods}.
Their activities, ranging from herbivory to decomposition, contribute substantially
to nutrient cycling, as they assist in the breakdown and redistribution of organic matter \parencite{COLEMAN2024131}.
By directly consuming microbes or
indirectly influencing microbial communities through their interactions with
plant roots, arthropods modulate the functional potential of the soil microbiome \parencite{Thakur2019}.

The interconnectedness of these groups is exemplified by the dynamic relationship
between plants, soil microbes, and arthropods \parencite{Fry2019}.
Thus, understanding the interplay between these diverse biotic components is of
importance to grasp the complex soil functioning interactions \parencite{briones2014soilfauna}.
Further exploration of these connections, particularly their influence on the
functional potential of the soil fauna, may lead to advancements in
sustainable agriculture and ecosystem management strategies \parencite{GRANDY201640}.

Decoupling the ecosystem functioning contributions of arthropods has been investigating since the seventies as seen in \textcite{rosswall1997energetical}.
Yet, there are gaps in this line of research due to the difficulty of studying these organisms.
Currently, the world is facing the so-called insect apocalypse and a large 
body of work is focused on understanding this phenomenon and also mitigating it with 
conservation and protection \parencite{cardoso2019predicting}. Because to being able to study arthropods, they
first have to be preserved and conserved.
Conservation efforts are either through protected areas or specific taxon protection.

Regarding Crete island, there are many protection areas like the 
Natura2000 and Wildlife refuges as shown in Figure \ref{fig:crete_data_cube_map}.
Natura2000 has been praised for each coverage of important biodiversity areas in 
Crete \parencite{spiliopoulou2021the-natura,kougioumoutzis2021plant}. Even though 
these areas weren't designed based on arthropods it seems they cover them 
adequately \parencite{bolanakis2024}. This is not a global trend though \parencite{chowdhury2023three-quarters}.
Regarding the
assessments of species though, arthropods are underrepresented globally and in Crete.

The Arthropods of Crete are continuously studied for more than 200 years \parencite{Anastasiou2018Tenebrionid}.
The bibliography and the NHMC collection was curated for arthropods occurrences.
More than 100 published documents were compiled along with 733 NHMC sampling events
(\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10635645}{data online availability}).
This dataset contains a total of 343 taxa (species and subspecies),
with 4,924 occurrences in 1,569 locations across the island of Crete. This is the most
complete dataset of Arthropods of Crete.
The taxa are distributed to eleven orders, with Coleoptera having the most taxa (206)
and Chilopoda and Scorpiones the least (two).
Based on the criteria described in \textcite{bolanakis2024} the data resulted in the
following orders:
Araneae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera (Chrysididae, Formicidae, Symphyta), Lepidoptera (Geometridae), Odonata, Orthoptera, Scorpiones and Trichoptera.

How are these species distributed across the island and which are the endemicity hotspots?
Answering this question will be an important first step towards the evaluation of the 
state of arthropod fauna of Crete. To do so it is important to minimise sampling biases and investigate how
the grid size influences the inference of such hotspots \parencite{hurlbert2007species,nhancale2011the-influence}.
This is not trivial \parencite{mo2019influences} and relies on
on the conservation aims \parencite{margules2000systematic}.
Currently there are many tools and standards to employ such analyses \parencite{bongaarts2019ipbes}.

In this chapter, the following aspects are investigated :
\begin{itemize}
    \item identify cretan arthropods available information,
    \item compare with the endemics of Crete,
    \item infer the endemicity hotspots,
    \item their relation with the anthropogenic pressures in these sites.
\end{itemize}

% METHODS
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:arthropods-method}
   
    \subsection{Data retrieval}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-land-use}

The occurrences of the endemic arthropods of Crete were downloaded from the
\href{https://zenodo.org/records/10635645}{Zenodo repository}. This dataset
is a manually compiled dataset from the Natural History Museum of Crete \parencite{bolanakis2024}.

Retrieval and compilation of information on arthropod species' taxonomy,
global distributions, and IUCN status was performed using public databases.
Taxa from IUCN that appear in Crete were downloaded from the website \parencite{iucn2024}. IUCN provides the 
interactive maps selection functionality. 
The dataset of endemic species assessments from a TSV file and several IUCN Red
List datasets for Greece, endemic Greek species, Europe, and the world.
Each Red List dataset, was processed to identify threatened species
(those categorized as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable).
They were grouped by taxonomic order and threat status, and a source identifier was created.
All arthropod species names from the IUCN Red List were used to retrieve their GBIF IDs
and resolve their species names using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy.
This taxonomy was used to harmonise and summarise all different datasets from IUNC

Reference grids were downloaded as shapefiles from \href{https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/3c362237-daa4-45e2-8c16-aaadfb1a003b}{EEA reference grid}.
The European Environment Agency grids are the standard reporting format of the Bern Convention
on the Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCI).

Landscape changes are mostly due to human activities in Crete.
The Historic Land Dynamics Assessment (HILDA+) dataset \parencite{winkler2021global}
is a global analysis to identify land use changes using remote sensing and 
historical data. Crete was cropped from this dataset and the land use change was 
summarised for 20 years period, from 1998 to 2018. This period has the most 
high quality data baselines. The dataset is in raster format of 1 km\textsuperscript{2}
resolution. Each year has one raster file with values the ids of the land use. 
Using the 1998 and 2018 baselines, they were combined to calculate the 
transitions of each cell from one id to another. Some cells have undergone 
multiple transitions during this period which are neglected in the analysis.

    \subsection{Taxa distributions}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-eoo-aoo}

Endemic arthropod distributions were estimated using the criterion B of IUCN. 
Three metrics are important in the criterion B, the Extent of Occurrence (EOO),
the Area of Occupancy (AOO) and 
number of locations of a species that are 10km apart.
AOO function input is the shapefile of a species occurrences,
a baseline map (Crete), a shapefile of overlap areas (protected areas and land use maps),
Initially, each species' AOO is calculated, converting the data to a spatial feature
and calculating its area in square kilometers. 
AOO function was set to use 2x2 km grids that it maps on the area after 1000
repeats. The placement of the grid with maximum squares is selected and this AOO 
is selected for a taxon. Hence, AOO rasterized taxon occurrences to an optimum 
2x2km grid to estimate its' distribution.

The Extent of Occurrence (EOO) calculation is the convex hull polygon of the occurrences 
of a taxon. There are cases where this metric is overlapping with marine areas due 
to the nature of the polygon. Hence this metric tends to overestimate the 
total area of distribution of a taxon.
The EOO for a single species is calculated if there are more than three occurrences.
Together, these calculation provide a comprehensive method for calculating and
assessing the AOO and EOO of arthropods, including their overlaps with protected
areas, as part of the IUCN assessment process. This approach allows for detailed
spatial analysis and visualization, facilitating the conservation status evaluation of arthropod species.


    \subsection{Grid assay}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-ehs-kbas}

Assessments of hotspots of endemic and threatened species of Cretan arthropods
ware carried out using various grid sizes, including 1, 4, 8, and 10 square kilometers, and
adaptive resolution algorithms such as quadtree. 
Endemicity Hotspots (EH) used here are the local biodiversity hotspots which contain
the 10\% of the richest (in endemic taxa) grid cells.
The testing of different grid sizes and the adaptive grid is helpful to avoid 
spatial scale biases and sampling biases.
Arthropod order biases were also investigated to examine whether some species
rich taxonomic groups drive the hotspots (e.g. Coleoptera). Hence, endemicity 
hotspots were also created for each order and their overlap was measured.

To facilitate this analysis, the essential data, including endemic species occurrences, Crete shapefiles
are used. For each grid size, occurrence
data were transformed and joined to calculate distinct species and sampling efforts,
and correlations between species richness and sampling intensity.
The 1km\textsuperscript{2} and 10 km\textsuperscript{2} grids are the 
EEA reference grid.
These grids are in shapefile format and their handling involves spatial joins,
summarizing species occurrences, and calculating sampling intensity,
followed by Pearson correlation assessment.

The 4 and 8 km\textsuperscript{2} grids utilize manually created rasters to map occurrences and
sampling efforts, with similar summarization and correlation steps.
The adaptive resolution grid is based on quadtrees, generating spatial polygons
and assessing species richness and endemicity hotspots.
The minimum cell length was set to 1 km\textsuperscript{2} and maximum to 10 km\textsuperscript{2}.
The algorithm split threshold was set to 4, i.e. if a grid has more than 4 samplings
it is split.
All various grid sizes and the adaptive quadtree approach, provide a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity hotspots on Crete.


    \subsection{Code}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-tools}

The coordinate reference system WGS84 - EPSG:4326 was used throughout the analysis.
Data, like the EEA reference grid were transformed to EPSG:4326 prior analysis.

All calculations, spatial data handling and data retrieval were implemented using the R Statistical Software \parencite{rcoreteam}.
Ggplot2 package was used for bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots and maps \parencite{wickham_ggplot2_2016}.
EOO was calculated with a custom function and AOO using the ConR R package \parencite{dauby2017conr:}.
Spatial analysis involved polygon and raster data handling, using the sf v1.0-14 \parencite{pebesma2018simple}
and terra v1.7-55 R packages \parencite{hijmans2024terra}, respectively.
Quadtree R package was used to infer the adaptive resolution grids \parencite{friend2023quadtree}.
Code is reproducible and available in this 
\href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/arthropoda_assessment_crete}{GitHub repository}.


% RESULTS
\section{Results}
\label{sec:arthropods-results}

    \subsection{EOO and AOO}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-sampling}

The Orders of Arthropods under this study are Araneae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera,
Diplopoda, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera (Chrysididae, Formicidae, Symphyta),
Lepidoptera (Geometridae), Odonata, Orthoptera, Scorpiones and Trichoptera.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS1}, the taxa that are assessed are 
a very low number comparing to identified taxa. The dataset contains 343 taxa species and subspecies).
These taxa have been documented in 4,924 occurrences across 1,569 sampling sites in the island.
Only 135 of known species (1.9\%) \textcite{legakis2018} have been assessed in IUCN,
making Arthropods the third most evaluated group of the
island, behind vascular plants (291) and land mollusks (165), see also Table \ref{table:crete_iucn_phyla}.

      \label{fig:arthropods-figS1}
   \end{figure}

The preliminary assessment using EOO and AOO assisted to assign approximately the 
categories of IUCN, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-eoo-aoo}.
Both metrics are required and the almost linear positive relationship is also visible. 
In addition, most endemics are near the origin of axes, reflecting the narrow 
distributions of most endemics.
This rough assessment 
identified that many species could be assigned to Vulnerable and Endangered categories, though 
manual curation is required.

    \subsection{Hotspot size selection}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-grids}

The samplings cover all areas of Crete and it's satellite islands. 
Sampling intensity is not distributed equally across Crete, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}.
Most samplings appear in the mountains ranges of Crete and near Heraklion city.
Regarding Orders, Odonata are mostly found in lowlands of Crete, whereas 
most of the other Orders have been sampled in the mountains. 
Coleoptera are the most sampled Order as expected.

      \label{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}
   \end{figure}

Endemicity hotspots (EH) are the top 10\% of grid cells with the most taxa. 
In Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts}, different EHs are 
displayed depending on the grid cell size. The 8x8 and 10x10 km 
hotspots share similarities in the mountain range overlaps, yet there 
are differences in Rethymnon. The 4x4 km grid has also hotspots overlaps 
with the other two, but they appear more distributed across the island. 
There are some hotspots near touristic/archaeological spots and large cities.

      \caption[Comparisons of different grid sizes]{Comparisons of different grid sizes to identify hotspots.}
      \label{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts}
   \end{figure}
   
   Another grid type was used, the adaptive grid with quadtrees, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS5}. This type of grid changes 
size depending on the sampling intensity thereby excluding sampling biases. This
grid showed similar endemicity hotspots with the 8x8 and 10x10 km grids, Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}.

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
\textbf{Grids}              & \textbf{1 km\textsuperscript{2}} & \textbf{4 km\textsuperscript{2}} & \textbf{8 km\textsuperscript{2}} & \textbf{10 km\textsuperscript{2}} & \textbf{Adaptive cell size} \\

\textbf{10 km\textsuperscript{2}}             & -              & -              & -              & \textbf{1400}   & 646                         \\

\end{tabular}
\label{table:arthropods-tableS2}
\end{table}

   Another definition of endemicity hotspots is using 10\% of grids with maximum
overlap between the EHs of the different orders.
This yielded essentially the same mountains as aggregation points of EHs.
Only Thrypti is excluded with this method which is undersampled in groups such as
Orthoptera, Araneae, Tenebrionidae and Carabidae, but still has an important
endemic biodiversity mostly driven by Staphylinidae.

   \begin{figure}[htb!]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/arthropods-fig_grid_stat.png}
      \caption[Comparisons of proportions of endemics across grid sizes hotspots]{Comparisons of different grid sizes. A. The proportion of endemics. B. The Jaccard similarity across hotspots with the same grid size.}
      \label{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts-stat}
   \end{figure}

The EH of the 10 km cells had 283 unique species,
the 8 km cells had 278, the 4 km cells had 293, and adaptive cell sizes contained 267.
So the 4 km cells have the highest coverage in terms of species number but identified regions
are popular for tourism and recreation, suggesting that this grid size is more
sensitive to sample intensity. 
The largest overlap across grid sizes was observed between the 10 km and 8 km grids, with a
57\% similarity (detailed in Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}).
The 10 x 10 km grid also contains more endemics per cell which is 
an advantage for conservation purposes, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts-stat}.
In addition, this grid has the lowest Jaccard similarity across cells 
meaning that the cells contain different taxa, therefore increasing 
the endemic coverage, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts-stat}.
Furthermore, the 10 km grid is the EEA reference grid system for reporting.
Overall, the grid cell size of 10 x 10 km was proved to best the others, due to the
coarse and inconsistent nature of our dataset, which was compiled from various
sources and sampling efforts.

An additional validation of the choice of this grid, was to test it in each 
individual Order, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-hotspots-order}. Coleoptera 
have presence in all EHs of the 10 km grid, but they also have many overlaps 
with other Orders. Exceptions are Odonata, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-hotspots-orders-overlap}.

    \subsection{Land use changes}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-human-intervention}
The land use transitions from 1998 to 2018, based on the HILDA+ dataset, reveal
significant land changes in Crete, Natura2000 areas, and endemicity hotspots (EHs), Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}.
The most stable land use types are pasture/rangeland (5,124 km\textsuperscript{2})
and cropland (1,314 km\textsuperscript{2}).
Transitions include cropland to pasture/rangeland (565 km\textsuperscript{2}),
cropland to forest (178 km\textsuperscript{2}), and pasture/rangeland to
unmanaged grass/shrubland (137 km\textsuperscript{2}).
Natura2000 areas show similar stability in pasture/rangeland (2,594 km\textsuperscript{2})
and cropland (186 km\textsuperscript{2}), with notable transitions like
pasture/rangeland to unmanaged grass/shrubland (73 km\textsuperscript{2}) and
cropland to pasture/rangeland (74 km\textsuperscript{2}).
EHs primarily consist of stable pasture/rangeland (1,198 km\textsuperscript{2})
and forest (174 km\textsuperscript{2}), with significant transitions such as
pasture/rangeland to unmanaged grass/shrubland (38 km\textsuperscript{2}) and
cropland to pasture/rangeland (32 km\textsuperscript{2}).
An important note is that forests have increased in Crete by 189 km\textsuperscript{2}, 
and urban areas by 58 km\textsuperscript{2}.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:arthropods-discussion}

Arthropod species have huge gaps regarding their IUCN assessments worldwide,
country wide and in Crete, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS1}. 
This is a fact that has been documented in multiple occasions \parencite{cardoso2012the-underrepresentation, chowdhury2023protected}. 
Arthropods are mostly assessed with the Criterion B \parencite{cardoso2011adapting,carpaneto2015a-red-list},
because the criteria A, C, D and E are rarely available for these taxa.
This means that the assessments could exaggerate the dangers of Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting},
albeit being real. 

The endemic arthropods of Crete dataset is extremely inhomogeneous due to
different sampling methods and sampling efforts per order, as well as per family.
It is also historically inconsistent due to the variable interest towards
different groups in different times.
Thus, the handling of the occurrences of this dataset are kept with absolute numbers 
and are not normalised or extrapolated. 
Nevertheless, it is the most complete and integrated dataset regarding the Cretan Arthropods.
The congruence with EHs obtained in other studies with completely different
datasets (i.e. vascular plants) \parencite{kougioumoutzis2020plant} and their biogeographical interpretation suggest
that they are not a sampling artifact. 
This important bias was also tackled with the inference of the adaptive grid using quadtrees.
The grid size of this grid is based on the sampling intensity, the higher the
intensity and the cell breaks into smaller ones resulting in 157 grids with
8 km length, 38 with 4 km and 74 with 2 km. Essentially, yielding the same areas 
as hotspots, Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}. Furthermore, the 10x10km reference 
grid includes more endemics, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts-stat},
hence representing a better proxy for future conservation plans.

It appears that only in Coleoptera there is an oversample in the Cretan mountains \ref{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}.
On the other hand, the oversampling in the Cretan mountains is a result of two facts.
First, the high biodiversity that is concentrated there, creates a positive
feedback where new species are discovered in the mountains driving more experts
to search the mountains with more intensity.
Second, the geological and ecological
complexity of the mountain relief requires an intense sampling in order to
cover its habitat diversity. In contrast the lowlands are more homogeneous and require less sampling effort.

Endemicity hotspots of Crete are mostly concentrated at the major mountains. 
Similarly to other studies on plants \parencite{dimitrakopoulos2004questioning,kougioumoutzis2020plant}
and invertebrates \textcite{sfenthourakis2001hotspots},
Lefka Ori mountain range and mount Dikti have the most EHs, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts}.
Mountains are known for their increased biodiversity  \parencite{antonelli2018geological, Rahbek2019} 
and Crete follows this trend with endemic arthropods, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-hotspots-order}.

The satellite islands of Crete are consistently not obtained as EHs, with the exception of
Gavdos as an EH in the 4 x 4 km grid. The rest of the islands are not yielded
even with different grids, yet they host endemic species (i.e. Dionysades islands
host two endemic taxa of Tenebrionidae), and thus have conservation value.
Of course, all core islets of Crete are under Natura 2000 protection, thus the
assurance of the implementation of the network’s rules and measures will play an
important role in the conservation of their single island endemics.
Besides having single island endemic species, islets like Gavdos or Dionysades doe trigger
other criteria, like Key Biodiversity Areas that can be included in a conservation plan \parencite{farooq2023a-call}.
This analysis is a first approach of Crete’s Arthropods distribution and hotspot status.
The tools (but also the policies) behind the selection of adequate protection
areas need to be refined, but this is a global issue when it comes to spot areas
of biogeographical or conservational importance. 

Arthropod species, particularly insects within hotspots are significantly impacted
by human activities, notably agriculture, which represents 19.6\% of these activities \parencite{raven2021agricultural}.
Agriculture-related threats pose the foremost danger to insect species even within
protected areas \parencite{chowdhury2023protected}. There is an almost equal trend
of land-use change from cropland to forest and vice versa within EHs, Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}
This indicates a dual process of degradation and recovery across various sites.
Additional research is critical to understand the impact, positive or negative, of these transitions on endemic arthropods.
The transformation of a significant portion of cropland into pasture has dual
effects, such as a positive influence on Gnaphosidae communities \parencite{kaltsas2019overgrazed}
and negative effects on Carabidae species \parencite{kaltsas2013ground}.
Furthermore, the observed reduction in cropland may reflect the broader trend
of urbanization occurring largely outside EHs, but the potential shift towards
mountain areas due to new tourism forms could pose a serious threat to these important conservation areas.

Arthropods are crucial for soil functioning and their role as ecosystem engineers 
is mostly neglected \parencite{COLEMAN2024131}. There is still a lot of effort to decipher their interplay 
with plants and microbes but the first step is to conserve them and overcome the 
biases in conserving popular species \parencite{mammola2020towards}.
