Crete data since 19th century. 

To being able to study first they have to be conserved.

protected areas, IUCN assessments and hotspots and Key Biodiversity Areas


%% need to modify
Hotspot definitions vary from quantitative methods to experts opinions and curation.
In quantitative methods, grid size and shape influences the determination of
the areas of interest such as hotspots and key biodiversity areas \parencite{hurlbert2007species,nhancale2011the-influence}.
Choosing the size of the grid is not trivial \parencite{mo2019influences} and is dependent
on the conservation goals \parencite{margules2000systematic}. In the past decade,
there have been major advances for conservation standards, guidelines,
frameworks and tools available to be put into action \parencite{bongaarts2019ipbes}.

Numbering approximately 7,000 species [extrapolated from Fauna Europaea
\parencite{jong2014fauna} and \textcite{legakis2018}], the Arthropods of Crete, Greece,
have been studied for almost two centuries \parencite{Anastasiou2018Tenebrionid}.
Only 135 of these species (1.9\%) have been assessed in IUCN Red List as of
this publication, making Arthropods the third most evaluated group of the
island, behind vascular plants (291) and land mollusks (165).

Habitat loss and degradation occurs throughout Crete as a result of urban,
agricultural and touristic development. This is a major issue since habitat
loss is a major threat in Europe for many Arthropod groups,
e.g. Butterflies \parencite{VanSwaaycommission2010european}, Bees \parencite{nieto2014},
Orthoptera \parencite{hochkirch2016} and Saproxylic Beetles \parencite{Calix_2018}.
Climate change is predicted to induce scarcer yet more intense precipitation,
increase of drought locally \parencite{koutroulis2011spatiotemporal} and shrinkage as well as
possible shifts to the rainfall period \parencite{koutroulis2013impact}. Groups
associated with fresh water could be deeply impacted from the locally increased
drought and the increase in need of water for irrigation and domestic use,
e.g. Odonata \parencite{kalkman2010}, which has become harsher due to the
increase of agriculture and land use \parencite{tzanakakis2020challenges}. Stock raising
(sheep and goats) has always been an important aspect of Cretan life and
economy \parencite{rackham1996the-making}. Overgrazing impacts severely soil erosion,
soil moisture and vegetation \parencite{kosmas2015exploring,orestis2015exploring}. All the
above contribute to a worrying trend for Crete, i.e. the higher percentage of
Threatened endemic Arthropods when compared with the respective European
groups.

The bibliography and the NHMC collection was curated to assemble taxa
occurrences. The bibliography used
contains both historical and contemporary published material.
Using over 100 publications (as of 2020) and 733 NHMC sampling events
(\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10635645}{data online availability}), a dataset of 343 taxa (species and subspecies) was assembled,
with 4,924 records across 1,569 distinct sites of Crete. The taxa
are distributed to eleven orders, with Coleoptera having the most taxa (206)
and Chilopoda and Scorpiones the least (two).
Based on the criteria described in \textcite{bolanakis2024} the data resulted in the
following orders:
Araneae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera (Chrysididae, Formicidae, Symphyta), Lepidoptera (Geometridae), Odonata, Orthoptera, Scorpiones and Trichoptera.


In this study I aim to a) identify cretan arthropods available information
b) compare with the endemics of Crete
c) their relation with the anthropogenic pressures in these sites.
To do so, I assembled the accumulated knowledge of 
online databases.


% METHODS
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:arthropods-method}
   
    \subsection{Data retrieval}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-land-use}

The occurrences of the endemic arthropods of Crete were downloaded from the
\href{https://zenodo.org/records/10635645}{Zenodo repository}. This dataset
is a manually compiled dataset from the Natural History Museum of Crete \parencite{bolanakis2024}.

Retrieval and compilation of information on arthropod species' taxonomy,
global distributions, and IUCN status was performed using public databases.
Taxa from IUCN that appear in Crete were downloaded from the website \parencite{iucn2024}. IUCN provides the 
interactive maps selection functionality. 
The dataset of endemic species assessments from a TSV file and several IUCN Red
List datasets for Greece, endemic Greek species, Europe, and the world.
Each Red List dataset, was processed to identify threatened species
(those categorized as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable).
They were grouped by taxonomic order and threat status, and a source identifier was created.
All arthropod species names from the IUCN Red List were used to retrieve their GBIF IDs
and resolve their species names using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy.
This taxonomy was used to harmonise and summarise all different datasets from IUNC

Reference grids were downloaded as shapefiles from \href{https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/3c362237-daa4-45e2-8c16-aaadfb1a003b}{EEA reference grid}.
The European Environment Agency grids are the standard reporting format of the Bern Convention
on the Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCI).

Landscape changes are mostly due to human activities in Crete.
The Historic Land Dynamics Assessment (HILDA+) dataset \parencite{winkler2021global}
is a global analysis to identify land use changes using remote sensing and 
historical data. Crete was cropped from this dataset and the land use change was 
summarised for 20 years period, from 1998 to 2018. This period has the most 
high quality data baselines. The dataset is in raster format of 1 km\textsuperscript{2}
resolution. Each year has one raster file with values the ids of the land use. 
Using the 1998 and 2018 baselines, they were combined to calculate the 
transitions of each cell from one id to another. Some cells have undergone 
multiple transitions during this period which are neglected in the analysis.

    \subsection{Taxa distributions}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-eoo-aoo}

Endemic arthropod distributions were estimated using the criterion B of IUCN. 
Three metrics are important in the criterion B, the Extent of Occurrence (EOO),
the Area of Occupancy (AOO) and 
number of locations of a species that are 10km apart.
AOO function input is the shapefile of a species occurrences,
a baseline map (Crete), a shapefile of overlap areas (protected areas and land use maps),
Initially, each species' AOO is calculated, converting the data to a spatial feature
and calculating its area in square kilometers. 
AOO function was set to use 2x2 km grids that it maps on the area after 1000
repeats. The placement of the grid with maximum squares is selected and this AOO 
is selected for a taxon. Hence, AOO rasterized taxon occurrences to an optimum 
2x2km grid to estimate its' distribution.

The Extent of Occurrence (EOO) calculation is the convex hull polygon of the occurrences 
of a taxon. There are cases where this metric is overlapping with marine areas due 
to the nature of the polygon. Hence this metric tends to overestimate the 
total area of distribution of a taxon.
The EOO for a single species is calculated if there are more than three occurrences.
Together, these calculation provide a comprehensive method for calculating and
assessing the AOO and EOO of arthropods, including their overlaps with protected
areas, as part of the IUCN assessment process. This approach allows for detailed
spatial analysis and visualization, facilitating the conservation status evaluation of arthropod species.


    \subsection{Grid assay}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-ehs-kbas}

Assessments of hotspots of endemic and threatened species of Cretan arthropods
ware carried out using various grid sizes, including 1, 4, 8, and 10 square kilometers, and
adaptive resolution algorithms such as quadtree. 
Endemicity Hotspots (EH) used here are the local biodiversity hotspots which contain
the 10\% of the richest (in endemic taxa) grid cells.
The testing of different grid sizes and the adaptive grid is helpful to avoid 
spatial scale biases and sampling biases.
Arthropod order biases were also investigated to examine whether some species
rich taxonomic groups drive the hotspots (e.g. Coleoptera). Hence, endemicity 
hotspots were also created for each order and their overlap was measured.

To facilitate this analysis, the essential data, including endemic species occurrences, Crete shapefiles
are used. For each grid size, occurrence
data were transformed and joined to calculate distinct species and sampling efforts,
and correlations between species richness and sampling intensity.
The 1km\textsuperscript{2} and 10 km\textsuperscript{2} grids are the 
EEA reference grid.
These grids are in shapefile format and their handling involves spatial joins,
summarizing species occurrences, and calculating sampling intensity,
followed by Pearson correlation assessment.

The 4 and 8 km\textsuperscript{2} grids utilize manually created rasters to map occurrences and
sampling efforts, with similar summarization and correlation steps.
The adaptive resolution grid is based on quadtrees, generating spatial polygons
and assessing species richness and endemicity hotspots.
The minimum cell length was set to 1 km\textsuperscript{2} and maximum to 10 km\textsuperscript{2}.
The algorithm split threshold was set to 4, i.e. if a grid has more than 4 samplings
it is split.
All various grid sizes and the adaptive quadtree approach, provide a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity hotspots on Crete.


    \subsection{Code}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-tools}

The coordinate reference system WGS84 - EPSG:4326 was used throughout the analysis.
Data, like the EEA reference grid were transformed to EPSG:4326 prior analysis.

All calculations, spatial data handling and data retrieval were implemented using the R Statistical Software \parencite{rcoreteam}.
Ggplot2 package was used for bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots and maps \parencite{wickham_ggplot2_2016}.
EOO was calculated with a custom function and AOO using the ConR R package \parencite{dauby2017conr:}.
Spatial analysis involved polygon and raster data handling, using the sf v1.0-14 \parencite{pebesma2018simple}
and terra v1.7-55 R packages \parencite{hijmans2024terra}, respectively.
Quadtree R package was used to infer the adaptive resolution grids \parencite{friend2023quadtree}.
Code is reproducible and available in this 
\href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/arthropoda_assessment_crete}{GitHub repository}.

    \subsection{Hotspot size selection}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-grids}

Another definition of endemicity hotspots is using 10\% of grids with maximum
overlap between the EHs of the different orders.
This yielded essentially the same mountains as aggregation points of EHs.
Only Thrypti is excluded with this method which is undersampled in groups such as
Orthoptera, Araneae, Tenebrionidae and Carabidae, but still has an important
endemic biodiversity mostly driven by Staphylinidae.

   \begin{figure}[htp!]

      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{figures/arthropods-fig_crete_sampling_intensity_order.png}
      \caption[Sampling intensity]{Sampling intensity in Crete (i.e number of samples) in each 10 km grid for all samples and for each arthropod order.}
      \label{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}
   \end{figure}




The grid cell size 10 x 10 km is the most suitable for our study since our
dataset - being compiled from numerous different sources and sampling efforts -
is rather coarse and inhomogenous for a smaller cell size.
The unique taxa of the EHs of each grid is distributed as follows: 10 km=283,
8 km=278, 4 km=293, adaptive cells=267, with the 4km grid covering most endemic
species. The 4 km grid mostly highlighted areas known for their tourist/recreational activities,
indicating that it is more sensitive to sampling intensity.
Focusing on sampling we applied the adaptive grid size with quadtrees resulting
in 157 grids with 8 km length, 38 with 4 km and 74 with 2 km (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS5}).
This indicates the preference of larger cells for the majority of our dataset
even though a small percent of regions has higher density of sampling.
The highest overlap among all grids is between the 10 km and 8 km reaching
57\% (Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}). Finally, the 10 km grid has more taxa
per cell and is a reference grid system.
Based on our analysis and interoperability and reproducibility aims we choose
the 10 km EEA reference grid for the EHs and candidate KBAs inference.
Nevertheless, we also performed the WEGE analysis for KBAs using the adaptive
grid, yielding practically the same areas as the 10km grid minus Zakros (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-fig5}).
The same pipeline can not be done with EHs for they require a fixed cell size.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:arthropods-discussion}

Arthropod species have huge gaps regarding their IUCN assessments worldwide,
country wide and in Crete, as shown in Figure \ref{figures/arthropods-FigS1.png}. 
This is a fact that has been documented in multiple occasions \parencite{chowdhury2023protected}. 
Arthropods are mostly assessed with the Criterion B \parencite{cardoso2011adapting,carpaneto2015a-red-list},
because the criteria A, C, D and E are rarely available for these taxa.
This means that the assessments could exaggerate the dangers of Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting},
albeit being real. 

The endemic arthropods of Crete dataset is extremely inhomogeneous due to
different sampling methods and sampling efforts per order, as well as per family.
It is also historically inconsistent due to the variable interest towards
different groups in different times.
Thus, the handling of the occurrences of this dataset are kept with absolute numbers 
and are not normalised or extrapolated. 
Nevertheless, it is the most complete and integrated dataset regarding the Cretan Arthropods.
The congruence with EHs obtained in other studies with completely different
datasets (i.e. vascular plants) \parencite{kougioumoutzis2020plant} and their biogeographical interpretation suggest
that they are not a sampling artifact. 
This important bias was also tackled with the inference of the adaptive grid using quadtrees.
The grid size of this grid is based on the sampling intensity, the higher the
intensity and the cell breaks into smaller ones resulting in 157 grids with
8 km length, 38 with 4 km and 74 with 2 km. Essentially, yielding the same areas 
as hotspots, Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}. Furthermore, the 10x10km reference 
grid includes more endemics, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts-stat},
hence representing a better proxy for future conservation plans.

It appears that only in Coleoptera there is an oversample in the Cretan mountains \ref{fig:arthropods-sampling-intesity}.
On the other hand, the oversampling in the Cretan mountains is a result of two facts.
First, the high biodiversity that is concentrated there, creates a positive
feedback where new species are discovered in the mountains driving more experts
to search the mountains with more intensity.
Second, the geological and ecological
complexity of the mountain relief requires an intense sampling in order to
cover its habitat diversity. In contrast the lowlands are more homogeneous and require less sampling effort.

Endemicity hotspots of Crete are mostly concentrated at the major mountains. 
Similarly to other studies on plants \parencite{dimitrakopoulos2004questioning,kougioumoutzis2020plant}
and invertebrates \textcite{sfenthourakis2001hotspots},
Lefka Ori mountain range and mount Dikti have the most EHs, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-different-hotposts}.
Mountains are known for their increased biodiversity  \parencite{antonelli2018geological, Rahbek2019} 
and Crete follows this trend with endemic arthropods, Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-hotspots-order}.

The satellite islands of Crete are consistently not obtained as EHs, with the exception of
Gavdos as an EH in the 4 x 4 km grid. The rest of the islands are not yielded
even with different grids, yet they host endemic species (i.e. Dionysades islands
host two endemic taxa of Tenebrionidae), and thus have conservation value.
Of course, all core islets of Crete are under Natura 2000 protection, thus the
assurance of the implementation of the network’s rules and measures will play an
important role in the conservation of their single island endemics.
Besides having single island endemic species, islets like Gavdos or Dionysades doe trigger
other criteria, like Key Biodiversity Areas that can be included in a conservation plan \parencite{farooq2023a-call}.
This analysis is a first approach of Crete’s Arthropods distribution and hotspot status.
The tools (but also the policies) behind the selection of adequate protection
areas need to be refined, but this is a global issue when it comes to spot areas
of biogeographical or conservational importance. 

Arthropod species, particularly insects within hotspots are significantly impacted
by human activities, notably agriculture, which represents 19.6\% of these activities \parencite{raven2021agricultural}.
Agriculture-related threats pose the foremost danger to insect species even within
protected areas \parencite{chowdhury2023protected}. There is an almost equal trend
of land-use change from cropland to forest and vice versa within EHs, Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}
This indicates a dual process of degradation and recovery across various sites.
Additional research is critical to understand the impact, positive or negative, of these transitions on endemic arthropods.
The transformation of a significant portion of cropland into pasture has dual
effects, such as a positive influence on Gnaphosidae communities \parencite{kaltsas2019overgrazed}
and negative effects on Carabidae species \parencite{kaltsas2013ground}.
Furthermore, the observed reduction in cropland may reflect the broader trend
of urbanization occurring largely outside EHs, but the potential shift towards
mountain areas due to new tourism forms could pose a serious threat to these important conservation areas.

Arthropods are crucial for soil functioning and their role as ecosystem engineers 
is mostly neglected \parencite{COLEMAN2024131}. There is still a lot of effort to decipher their interplay 
with plants and microbes but the first step is to conserve them and overcome the 
biases in conserving popular species \parencite{mammola2020towards}.
