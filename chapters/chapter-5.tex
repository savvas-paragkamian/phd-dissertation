\chapter{Towards a Cretan soil biodiversity data system}
\label{cha:crete-idea}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro_idea}

Ecosystem ecology studies the interactions of organisms with their surroundings
as a whole \parencite{van-dyne1966ecosystems}. These interactions are complex and hard to interpret and quantify.
Macroscopically they represent the flows of energy and materials in the total environment.
The implications of this approach to ecosystems are that multiple types of disciplines 
are intersected. For example, soils are defined by their physical characteristics,
i.e grain size, clay content, their chemistry, i.e pH, elements compositions, and 
their biodiversity, i.e plants, arthropods and microbes \parencite{vogel2022}. Humans have influenced 
and/or exploited almost all the environments of earth with their activities.
Hence, understanding ecosystems requires a synthesis which in the digital era 
is becoming more and more plausible. 

There are multiple terms that describe the digital representation of ecosystems.
One of the earliest is "digital earth" which mentioned in the late 90s \parencite{Goodchild_2012}.
This notion of the virtual earth was initially realised with satellite imaging,
on-land sensors and the relevant software. Space, an area on Earth, is
the starting point of ecosystems functioning which is influenced by geography,
climate, geology, biodiversity and human management. The coupling of all these
fields, and the data they provide, with spatial information leads to the digital twin of ecosystems.

Studying Earth as a whole and thus generating data at the global scale, all at once,
is part of a new field called planetary biology. Smaller scales of such integrating systems exist like
the Island Digital Ecosystem Avatar \parencite{Davies2016}. Islandscapes 
is also an interesting approach which defines the holistic ecosystem of the island
and the interface of land and sea \parencite{Vogiatzakis_land_2017}. Also islands
due to their smaller scale are useful virtual ecological labs.

There are multiple tangible outcomes of integrating all these data gather together about a
specific place. First, it allows for sampling biases and gaps identification. Second, 
it enables testing new hypotheses about unforeseen associations of variables. Third, 
it forms a foundation of the current state of knowledge to assist decision making 
processes about conservation, ecosystem services management and comparisons for 
future states. Building such systems is also a cultural treasure for society because
they will present the uniqueness of each place.

Biodiversity is represented in ecosystems as point occurrences of each taxon. The
DarwinCore standards have assisted a lot the homogeneity of the data. GBIF is a 
global aggregator that contains such information about all ecosystems from 
different resources. It is crucial that each sampling point has rich metadata. 
Sequences from eDNA studies are also part of biodiversity and are stored in 
databases like ENA and GenBank.
From the bacterial point of view, metagenomic samples are abundant in these 
databases and there are also curated databases that classify them in some baseline functionality. 
There is also a wealth of knowledge about biodiversity in the literature. 
Databases like PubMed, Goolge Scholar, Dimentions and Biodiversity Heritage Library 
are world class providers with different content.

Examples of platforms that host open data soil data are the 
European Soil Data Centre \parencite{Panagos2022} and the World Soil Information
Service (WoSIS) of the ISRIC \parencite{Batjes2024}. Apart from samplings and literature,
spatial data are openly available terrestrial ecosystems.
To name a few, there openly available climatic, land cover, desertification risk, aridity, soil type, normalized
vegetation index, bedrock geological formations data.

In this chapter, the focus is system's approach of the soil ecosystems of the island of Crete.
First, the literature about Crete is aggregated and summarised. Second, biodiversity data
from GBIF and IUCN are collected and third a spatial data cube is created. 
Having all these data joined about Crete shows the culmination of intensive 
research of the Cretan environments over the centuries and provokes for new
hypotheses and conservation priorities.


\section{Materials and Methods}\label{integration_methods}

\subsection{Literature}\label{crete-literature}

Pubmed was searched using the DIG tool \parencite{fanini2021coupling}.

\subsection{Samplings}\label{crete_samplings}

\subsection{Spatial data}\label{crete_spatial}


\subsection{Tools}\label{Coding environment}
Visualisation was implemented with ggplot2 \parencite{wickham_ggplot2_2016} and pheatmap \parencite{Kolde2019}.
The environment we worked had Python 3.11.4, R version 4.3.2 \parencite{rcoreteam}.
Finally, computations were performed on HPC infrastructure of HCMR \parencite{zafeiropoulos_0s_2021}.

\subsection{Data and Code}
Scripts about data integration are available in
\href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/crete-data-integration}{Crete data integration}.
Code is structured to be reproducible and interoperable.

\section{Results}\label{crete_idea_results}

\subsection{Historical and Contemporary literature}


\subsection{Biodiversity and samplings}

Worldwide projects of microbiome studies have collected one or two topsoil
samples from Crete \parencite{Vasar2022, Labouyrie2023, Bahram2018, Orgiazzi2018}.
Some have focused on soil fungi \parencite{Mikryukov2023, Davison2021, Tedersoo2021}
and other soil eukaryotes \parencite{Aslani2022}.
The only thorough microbiome study of a soil ecosystem in Crete, to our knowledge,
is in the north west part of the island, the Koiliaris Critical Zone Observatory \parencite{tsiknia2014}.
Apart from the soil microbiome, soil physical and chemical properties has been
investigated by global and European projects like the Forum of European Geological Surveys
(FOREGS) \parencite{nerc19017}, the Geochemical Mapping of Agricultural and Grazing Land
Soil in Europe (GEMAS) \parencite{REIMANN2018302} and the Soil Profile Analytical
Database for Europe (SPADE) \parencite{Hiederer2006}.
