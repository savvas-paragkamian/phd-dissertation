% ABSTRACT
%\section{Abstract}
%
%Arthropod decline has been globally and locally documented, yet they are still
%not sufficiently protected. Crete (Greece), a Mediterranean biodiversity
%hotspot, is a continental island renowned for its diverse geology, ecosystems
%and endemicity of flora and fauna, with continuous research on its Arthropod
%fauna dating back to the 19th century. Here we investigate the conservation
%status of the Cretan Arthropods using Preliminary Automated Conservation
%Assessments (PACA) and the overlap of Cretan Arthropod distributions with the
%Natura 2000 protected areas. Moreover we investigate their endemicity hotspots
%and propose candidate Key Biodiversity Areas. In order to perform these
%analyses, we assembled occurrences of the endemic Arthropods in Crete located
%in the collections of the Natural History Museum of Crete together with
%literature data. These assessments resulted in 75\% of endemic Arthropods as
%potentially threatened. The hotspots of endemic taxa and the candidate Key
%Biodiversity Areas are distributed mostly on the mountainous areas where the
%Natura 2000 protected areas have great coverage. Yet human activities have
%significant impact even in those areas, while some taxa are not sufficiently
%covered by Natura 2000. These findings call for countermeasures and conservation actions.

% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:arthropods-intro}

Numbering approximately 7,000 species [extrapolated from Fauna Europaea
\parencite{jong2014fauna} and \textcite{legakis2018}], the Arthropods of Crete, Greece,
have been studied for almost two centuries \parencite{Anastasiou2018Tenebrionid}.
Only 135 of these species (1.9\%) have been assessed in IUCN Red List as of
this publication, making Arthropods the third most evaluated group of the
island, behind vascular plants (291) and land mollusks (165).

Habitat loss and degradation occurs throughout Crete as a result of urban,
agricultural and touristic development. This is a major issue since habitat
loss is a major threat in Europe for many Arthropod groups,
e.g. Butterflies \parencite{VanSwaaycommission2010european}, Bees \parencite{nieto2014},
Orthoptera \parencite{hochkirch2016} and Saproxylic Beetles \parencite{Calix_2018}.
Climate change is predicted to induce scarcer yet more intense precipitation,
increase of drought locally \parencite{koutroulis2011spatiotemporal} and shrinkage as well as
possible shifts to the rainfall period \parencite{koutroulis2013impact}. Groups
associated with fresh water could be deeply impacted from the locally increased
drought and the increase in need of water for irrigation and domestic use,
e.g. Odonata \parencite{kalkman2010}, which has become harsher due to the
increase of agriculture and land use \parencite{tzanakakis2020challenges}. Stock raising
(sheep and goats) has always been an important aspect of Cretan life and
economy \parencite{rackham1996the-making}. Overgrazing impacts severely soil erosion,
soil moisture and vegetation \parencite{kosmas2015exploring,orestis2015exploring}. All the
above contribute to a worrying trend for Crete, i.e. the higher percentage of
Threatened endemic Arthropods when compared with the respective European
groups (Appendix Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS1}).

Using over 100 publications (as of 2020) and 733 NHMC sampling events
(\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10635645}{Supplementary Material}), we assembled a dataset of 343 taxa (species and subspecies),
with 4,924 records across 1,569 distinct sites of Crete. The taxa
are distributed to eleven orders, with Coleoptera having the most taxa (206)
and Chilopoda and Scorpiones the least (two).

In this study I aim to a) identify cretan arthropods available information
b) compare with the the endemics of Crete
c) their relation with the anthropogenic pressures in these sites.
To do so, I assembled the accumulated knowledge of 
online databases.
Secondly, we committed to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) principles \parencite{wilkinson2016the-fair}
for data and code (see \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10635645}{Supplementary Material}).


% METHODS
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:arthropods-method}
   
    \subsection{Taxa selection criteria}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-taxa-selection}

We aggregated data of Cretan endemic Arthropod groups (NHMC collections and bibliography). The taxa included should satisfy the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}

    \item There should be at least one authoritative work on the group for Crete which
should make clear remarks about the group’s taxonomic dynamics, so that future
taxonomical or systematic works on the taxon would not severely affect our inferences.
In essence, we selected groups whose biodiversity is well studied and we do not
expect significant changes in their number of species for Crete. 

    \item The geographic information about the endemic species distribution should be in
a form convertible to coordinates (i.e., either in coordinates or with a
precise locality). The included coordinates are precise, while the converted
ones do not exceed a radius of certainty more than 2 km.

    \item The group should not be dominated by cavernicolous species. We opted to exclude
cave dwelling fauna, since it is a special system, governed by different
biogeographical and ecological processes. Thus, groups like terrestrial Isopods
were excluded for their high percentage of cavernicolous species \parencite{schmalfuss2004the-terrestrial,sfendourakis2018}.

\end{itemize}

Based on the above criteria, the selected groups are:
Araneae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera (Chrysididae, Formicidae, Symphyta), Lepidoptera (Geometridae), Odonata, Orthoptera, Scorpiones and Trichoptera.

    \subsection{Data assemblage}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-data-assemblage}

We curated the bibliography and the NHMC collection to assemble taxa
occurrences. The bibliography used
contains both historical and contemporary published material.
The coordinate reference system we used for all location data is WGS84 - EPSG:4326.

From here on, we refer to both species
and subspecies as “taxa”.
    

    \subsection{Taxa distributions}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-taxa-assessments}
For the taxa assessment I used the Preliminary Automated Conservation Assessment
(PACA) pipeline \parencite{stevart2019a-third}. PACA is an approximation of the IUCN
assessment based on 

Criterion B, i.e. on the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and
Area of Occupancy (AOO).

Criterion B is the widely used for Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting,carpaneto2015a-red-list},
because the majority of Arthropods taxa are missing neccessary information of the other criteria (A, C, D and E).
Criterion B could overestimate the danger of Arthropods \parencite{cardoso2011adapting},
which should always be taken into consideration.

    
    \subsection{Endemicity Hotspots (EHs), and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs)}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-ehs-kbas}

Hotspot definitions vary from quantitative methods to experts opinions and curation.
In quantitative methods, grid size and shape influences the determination of
the areas of interest such as hotspots and key biodiversity areas \parencite{hurlbert2007species,nhancale2011the-influence}.
Choosing the size of the grid is not trivial \parencite{mo2019influences} and is dependent
on the conservation goals \parencite{margules2000systematic}. In the past decade,
there have been major advances for conservation standards, guidelines,
frameworks and tools available to be put into action \parencite{bongaarts2019ipbes}.

In order to avoid biases concerning the grid cell size, the same
pipeline was tested with cells of different size (4 x 4, 8 x 8 and 10 x 10 km).
For the subsequent analyses we opted for the 10 x 10 km grid (see section \ref{subsec:arthropods-grids})
which is also the EEA reference grid, the standard for the reporting format
(Groups of Experts, 2017) of the Resolution No. 8 (2012) of the Standing Committee
to the Bern Convention on the Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCI).
Moreover, the EHs of the various cell sizes are aggregated in the same areas.
We made the same treatment for each of the selected groups separately.
We redefined EHs as the 10\% of the grid cells with max overlap of the orders
to check for biases towards more speciose orders (e.g. Coleoptera).

For the investigation of KBAs \parencite{iucn2016} we used the WEGE index \parencite{farooq2020wege}
on the same grid as hotspots based on the PACA assessments and the distributions
of the taxa. WEGE can be used to indicate candidate KBAs or prioritize already
existing KBAs (given the limited resources available for conservation) but does
not replace a throughout KBAs assessment \parencite{farooq2020wege}.

    \subsection{Spatial overlaps}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-spatial}
I retrieved land use categories from the CORINE Land Cover, CLC 2018 version
v.2020-20u1 \parencite{CLC2023}.
To evaluate the current land use I used the CORINE Land Cover
and to examine the human pressure (change in land use, agriculture), I used the
Historic Land Dynamics Assessment (HILDA+) dataset \parencite{winkler2021global} to
estimate the change of land use the from 1998 to 2018. Furthermore, I examined
the overlap of the AOO.


    \subsection{Tools and scripts}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-tools}
We performed the analyses using the R Statistical Software \parencite{rcoreteam},
the visualization using the ggplot2 R package \parencite{wickham_ggplot2_2016}. The figures
created are colored using the colorblind-friendly 'Okabe-Ito' palette \parencite{ichihara2008color}.
We calculated EOO and AOO using the ConR R package \parencite{dauby2017conr:} and PACA
using custom scripts. For the spatial data handling, transformations and
geometry we used the sf v1.0-14 \parencite{pebesma2018simple} and terra v1.7-55 R packages \parencite{hijmans2024terra}.
WEGE index is calculated with the WEGE R package \parencite{farooq2020wege}.
Adaptive grid is created using the quadtree R package \parencite{friend2023quadtree}.
Jaccard similarity was calculated with the vegan 2.6-4 R package \parencite{oksanen2024vegan}.
All scripts are reproducible by design and available in this 
\href{https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/arthropoda_assessment_crete}{GitHub repository}.

      \label{fig:arthropods-figS1}
   \end{figure}

    \subsection{Grid cell size}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-grids}
The grid cell size 10 x 10 km is the most suitable for our study since our
dataset - being compiled from numerous different sources and sampling efforts -
is rather coarse and inhomogenous for a smaller cell size.
The unique taxa of the EHs of each grid is distributed as follows: 10 km=283,
8 km=278, 4 km=293, adaptive cells=267, with the 4km grid covering most endemic
species. The 4 km grid mostly highlighted areas known for their tourist/recreational activities,
indicating that it is more sensitive to sampling intensity.
Focusing on sampling we applied the adaptive grid size with quadtrees resulting
in 157 grids with 8 km length, 38 with 4 km and 74 with 2 km (Appendix Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-figS5}).
This indicates the preference of larger cells for the majority of our dataset
even though a small percent of regions has higher density of sampling.
The highest overlap among all grids is between the 10 km and 8 km reaching
57\% (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS2}). Finally, the 10 km grid has more taxa
per cell and is a reference grid system.
Based on our analysis and interoperability and reproducibility aims we choose
the 10 km EEA reference grid for the EHs and candidate KBAs inference.
Nevertheless, we also performed the WEGE analysis for KBAs using the adaptive
grid, yielding practically the same areas as the 10km grid minus Zakros (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-fig5}).
The same pipeline can not be done with EHs for they require a fixed cell size.

In order to evaluate the human impact in the yielded EHs and candidate KBAs we
used CORINE layers (Figure \ref{fig:arthropods-fig5}). At LEVEL 1 of the classification, the dominant
habitat is “Forest and semi-natural areas”, covering ~ 76-78\% of the EHs/KBAs,
while agricultural areas also display coverage of 20-22\%. This exhibits the
presence of human activity in the EHs/KBAs. Using the LEVEL 2 CORINE
layer, we acquired a more detailed image of the coverage. The dominant habitat
seems to consist of scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation  (56\% coverage),
forests (12\%), permanent crops (10\%) and open spaces with little or
no vegetation (10\%) (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS3}). With HILDA+ we
estimated some negative and some positive transitions within the EHs/KBAs in
the previous two decades (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}). Around 10-12\% of
forest area has been transformed to cropland. Likewise 22-25\% of cropland has
been transformed to pastureland. On the other hand 15-26\% of cropland area has
been transformed to forest. Worryingly urban areas have increased for about 16.8\%,
although outside EHs and KBAs mainly at the expense of croplands and
pasturelands (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}). Finally, water areas remain
stable, albeit more research is needed to assess potential decreases in the
quality of this habitat, especially given the aggressive urban and touristic expansion.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:arthropods-discussion}

    \subsection{Endemicity Hotspots}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-Endemicity-Hotspots}

Mountains host a great amount of Earth’s biodiversity, being a main driver for
the birth of species \parencite{antonelli2018geological,noroozi2018hotspots,rahbek2019building,Rahbek2019}
and a crucial frontier for their fate \parencite{steinbauer2018accelerated,urban2018escalator}.
Crete is not an exception to this trend \parencite{kougioumoutzis2020plant,trigas2013elevational}.
Our results conform to that, since the EHs are gathered primarily in the major
Cretan mountains. Lefka Ori and Dikti are the sites with the most
EHs, in agreement with studies focused on vascular plants \parencite{dimitrakopoulos2004questioning,kougioumoutzis2020plant}.
\textcite{sfenthourakis2001hotspots}, employing invertebrate groups, also recovered these mountains as EHs.

Islands are biodiversity sanctuaries \parencite{whittaker2007island}, and
so are mountains \parencite{rahbek2019humboldts}. Our work advocates for approaches that
treat islands and mountains under a holistic perspective. The combination of
the two provides a complex biogeographical interplay governing the forces of
speciation, preservation and extinction of biodiversity \parencite{steinbauer2016topography-driven}.
This synergistic effect of mountains-islands has also been recovered in other
areas such as the Balearic islands \parencite{guardiola2023are-mediterranean}.

    \subsection{Species assessment}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-species-assessment-disc}

Arthropods with wider ranges that are not assessed as Threatened under
criterion B, are not necessarily Least Concern and should not be neglected.
Arthropod communities can be affected by the reduction of the abundance of
common and abundant species that offer important functions to the biocommunity.
Wide range does not guarantee high abundance (even though this is true for many
taxa) and even common species can be threatened \parencite{habel2018vanishing,klink2023disproportionate}.

The inclusion of Arthropod taxa in protected areas is often insufficient, with
Arthropods experiencing declines inside the protected areas \parencite{borges2005ranking,chowdhury2023protected,harry2019protected,rada2019protected}.
In fact, even when certain Arthropod groups are adequately included in N2K,
there are gaps and omissions \parencite{sanchez-fernandez2008are-the-endemic,verovnik2011is-the-natura}.
At a global level 75\% of Insects are not sufficiently covered by protected
areas \parencite{chowdhury2023three-quarters}. Crete stands in an intermediate position,
following the general trend of Greece’s N2K adequacy, being the best covered
area at a national level \parencite{kougioumoutzis2021plant,spiliopoulou2021the-natura}.
However, there are some clear gaps regarding certain taxa, encouraging more
locally focused conservation policies complementary to N2K. For example actions
need to be taken for KBAs that fall outside N2K like Kritsa and Zakros.

Biases towards Arthropods cause their poor coverage by protected
areas \parencite{chowdhury2023protected,damen2013protected,delso2021protected}. These
biases derive from geography, size, color and charisma \parencite{cardoso2012habitats,mammola2020towards,wang2021out-of-sight},
and even from political/economic reasons \parencite{dias-silva2021protected}. For example,
the strongest driver for a conservation program funding within the European
Union is the online popularity \parencite{mammola2020towards}. The unpopularity of
Arthropods has begun to change \parencite{wagner2021insect}, especially through citizen
science, which is a trend we should build on to properly conserve the Arthropods.

    \subsection{Human Intervention in Arthropods’ EHs}
    \label{subsec:arthropods-human-intervention-ehs}
Human activities account for almost 20\% of the EHs. The primary human activity
in the EHs is agriculture (~19.6\%). Agricultural intensification is one of the
most important drivers of Arthropods’ decline \parencite{bruhl2019biodiversity,habel2019agricultural,raven2021agricultural}.
Moreover, threats associated with agriculture are the number one threat for
Insect species inside protected areas in Europe \parencite{chowdhury2023protected}.
Nevertheless, regarding change in land use, there is a somewhat equal
transition trend from cropland to forest and vice versa inside EHs and KBAs
(Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}). This means that while some sites are being
degraded others may recover. More research within EHs and KBAs is essential in
order to quantify the impact (negative or positive) of these transitions to the
endemic Arthropods. A vast amount of cropland has been transformed to pasture
lands (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}) which requires further examination,
since grazing has both positive [eg. on Gnaphosidae (Spiders) communities \parencite{kaltsas2019overgrazed}]
and negative effects [e.g. Carabidae (Coleoptera) \parencite{kaltsas2013ground}].
The reduction of croplands could be interpreted under the general trend of
urbanization (Appendix Table \ref{table:arthropods-tableS4}), which nevertheless occurs
outside EHs and KBAs, but a shift towards montane areas especially under new
forms of tourism could deeply impact the sites of conservation importance.
