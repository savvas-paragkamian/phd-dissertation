  abstract = {Despite advances in sequencing, lack of standardization makes comparisons across studies challenging and hampers insights into the structure and function of microbial communities across multiple habitats on a planetary scale. Here we present a multi-omics analysis of a diverse set of 880 microbial community samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data, and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry). We used standardized protocols and analytical methods to characterize microbial communities, focusing on relationships and co-occurrences of microbially related metabolites and microbial taxa across environments, thus allowing us to explore diversity at extraordinary scale. In addition to a reference database for metagenomic and metabolomic data, we provide a framework for incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of existing knowledge in the form of an evolving community resource. We demonstrate the utility of this database by testing the hypothesis that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere but the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both microbial communities and the environment, whereas the relative abundances of microbially related metabolites vary and co-occur with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner. We additionally show the power of certain chemistry, in particular terpenoids, in distinguishing Earth’s environments (for example, terrestrial plant surfaces and soils, freshwater and marine animal stool), as well as that of certain microbes including Conexibacter woesei (terrestrial soils), Haloquadratum walsbyi (marine deposits) and Pantoea dispersa (terrestrial plant detritus). This Resource provides insight into the taxa and metabolites within microbial communities from diverse habitats across Earth, informing both microbial and chemical ecology, and provides a foundation and methods for multi-omics microbiome studies of hosts and the environment.}

It is thus essential to identify general macroecological patterns related to the distribution and functioning of soil organisms to support their conservation and consideration by governance. These macroecological analyses need to represent the diversity of environmental conditions that can be found worldwide. Here we identify and characterize existing environmental gaps in soil taxa and ecosystem functioning data across soil macroecological studies and 17,186 sampling sites across the globe. These data gaps include important spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.3\% of all sampling sites having both information about biodiversity and function, although with different taxonomic groups and functions at each site. Based on this information, we provide clear priorities to support and expand soil macroecological research.}

Historically, soil assessments focused on crop production, but, today, soil health also includes the role of soil in water quality, climate change and human health. However, quantifying soil health is still dominated by chemical indicators, despite growing appreciation of the importance of soil biodiversity, owing to limited functional knowledge and lack of effective methods. In this Perspective, the definition and history of soil health are described and compared with other soil concepts. We outline ecosystem services provided by soils, the indicators used to measure soil functionality and their integration into informative soil-health indices. Scientists should embrace soil health as an overarching principle that contributes to sustainability goals, rather than only a property to measure.}

Here, using two independent global standardized field surveys, and a range of natural and human factors, we test the relationship between the number of environmental stressors exceeding different critical thresholds and the maintenance of multiple ecosystem services across biomes. Our analysis shows that having multiple stressors, from medium levels ({$>$}50\%), negatively and significantly correlates with impacts on ecosystem services and that having multiple stressors crossing a high-level critical threshold (over 75\% of maximum observed levels) reduces soil biodiversity and functioning globally. The number of environmental stressors exceeding the {$>$}75\% threshold was consistently seen as an important predictor of multiple ecosystem services, therefore improving prediction of ecosystem functioning. Our findings highlight the need to reduce the dimensionality of the human footprint on ecosystems to conserve biodiversity and function.}

Here, we describe this new field, show how it relates to modern ecological study, and highlight opportunities that stem from taking a macrosystems perspective. We present a hierarchical framework for investigating macrosystems at any level of ecological organization and in relation to broader and finer scales. Building on well-established theory and concepts from other subdisciplines of ecology, we identify feedbacks, linkages among distant regions, and interactions that cross scales of space and time as the most likely sources of unexpected and novel behaviors in macrosystems. We present three examples that highlight the importance of this multiscaled systems perspective for understanding the ecology of regions to continents.},

For example, how can we advance science and technology, change human behavior, and influence political will to enable societies to meet targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change? At the same time, how can we meet needs for food, water, improved health and human security, and enhanced energy security? Can this be done while also meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and ensuring ecosystem integrity?}

Efforts are underway to increase the resilience of some ecosystems that are under threat, yet collective awareness and action are modest at best. Here, we highlight the potential for a biosphere resilience sensing system to make it easier to see where things are going wrong, and to see whether deliberate efforts to make things better are working. We focus on global resilience sensing of the terrestrial biosphere at high spatial and temporal resolution through satellite remote sensing, utilizing the generic mathematical behaviour of complex systems—loss of resilience corresponds to slower recovery from perturbations, gain of resilience equates to faster recovery. We consider what subset of biosphere resilience remote sensing can monitor, critically reviewing existing studies. Then we present illustrative, global results for vegetation resilience and trends in resilience over the last 20 years, from both satellite data and model simulations. We close by discussing how resilience sensing nested across global, biome-ecoregion, and local ecosystem scales could aid management and governance at these different scales, and identify priorities for further work.

In this Review, we demonstrate that soils are a cornerstone of one health and serve as a source and reservoir of pathogens, beneficial microorganisms and the overall microbial diversity in a wide range of organisms and ecosystems. We list more than 40 soil microbiome functions that either directly or indirectly contribute to soil, plant, animal and human health. We identify microorganisms that are shared between different one health compartments and show that soil, plant and human microbiomes are perhaps more interconnected than previously thought. Our Review further evaluates soil microbial contributions to one health in the light of dysbiosis and global change and demonstrates that microbial diversity is generally positively associated with one health. Finally, we present future challenges in one health research and formulate recommendations for practice and evaluation.}

The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying {$>$}30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent “axes of variation” shaped by markedly different processes.},

Determining the metabolic processes performed by microbial communities is crucial for understanding and managing ecosystem properties. Metagenomic approaches allow the elucidation of the main metabolic processes that determine the performance of microbial communities under different environmental conditions and perturbations. Here we present the first compartmentalized metabolic reconstruction at a metagenomics scale of a microbial ecosystem. This systematic approach conceives a meta-organism without boundaries between individual organisms and allows the in silico evaluation of the effect of agricultural intervention on soils at a metagenomics level. To characterize the microbial ecosystems, topological properties, taxonomic and metabolic profiles, as well as a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) were considered. Furthermore, topological and optimization algorithms were implemented to carry out the curation of the models, to ensure the continuity of the fluxes between the metabolic pathways, and to confirm the metabolite exchange between subcellular compartments. The proposed models provide specific information about ecosystems that are generally overlooked in non-compartmentalized or non-curated networks, like the influence of transport reactions in the metabolic processes, especially the important effect on mitochondrial processes, as well as provide more accurate results of the fluxes used to optimize the metabolic processes within the microbial community.},

Building a knowledge base (KB) consolidating these disconnected pieces is an essential first step to democratize and accelerate the process of accessing the collective discoveries of human disease connections to the human microbiome. In this article, we survey the existing tools and development efforts that have been produced to capture portions of the information needed to construct a KB of all known human microbiome-disease associations and highlight the need for additional innovations in natural language processing (NLP), text mining, taxonomic representations, and field-wide vocabulary standardization in human microbiome research. Addressing these challenges will enable the construction of KBs that help identify new insights amenable to experimental validation and potentially clinical decision support.},

Common approaches to investigate the human microbiota include high-throughput sequencing with subsequent correlative analyses. However, to understand the ecology of the human gut microbiota and consequently design novel treatments for diseases, it is important to represent the different interactions between microbes with their associated metabolites. Computational systems biology approaches can give further mechanistic insights by constructing data- or knowledge-driven networks that represent microbe interactions. In this minireview, we will discuss current approaches in systems biology to analyze the human gut microbiota, with a particular focus on constraint-based modeling. We will discuss various community modeling techniques with their advantages and differences, as well as their application to predict the metabolic mechanisms of intestinal microbial communities.

We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20\% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.},

  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {What is the potential for synthetic biology as a way of engineering, on a large scale, complex ecosystems? Can it be used to change endangered ecological communities and rescue them to prevent their collapse? What are the best strategies for such ecological engineering paths to succeed? Is it possible to create stable, diverse synthetic ecosystems capable of persisting in closed environments? Can synthetic communities be created to thrive on planets different from ours? These and other questions pervade major future developments within synthetic biology. The goal of engineering ecosystems is plagued with all kinds of technological, scientific and ethic problems. In this paper, we consider the requirements for terraformation, i.e., for changing a given environment to make it hospitable to some given class of life forms. Although the standard use of this term involved strategies for planetary terraformation, it has been recently suggested that this approach could be applied to a very different context: ecological communities within our own planet. As discussed here, this includes multiple scales, from the gut microbiome to the entire biosphere.},

In this chapter, we highlight the importance and potential of ENA in future biomonitoring programs, as current biomonitoring indicators (e.g. species richness, population abundances of targeted species) are mostly descriptive and unable to characterize the mechanisms that underpin ecosystem functioning. Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches, especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels, but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are now within ecologists reach.},

  abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are vital in mediating the earth’s biogeochemical cycles; yet, despite our rapidly increasing ability to explore complex environmental microbial communities, the relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: ‘When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?’ We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.},

Yet, microbial ecology and its role in ecosystem biochemistry remain poorly understood, partly because the enormous diversity found in microbial communities hinders their modeling. Despite this diversity, the bulk of global biogeochemical fluxes is driven by a few metabolic pathways encoded by a small set of genes, which through time have spread across microbial clades that can replace each other within metabolic niches. Hence, the question arises whether the dynamics of these pathways can be modeled regardless of the hosting organisms, for example based on environmental conditions. Such a pathway-centric paradigm would greatly simplify the modeling of microbial processes at ecosystem scales.},

  abstract = {Resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding are among the main drivers of microbial community assembly. Yet the degree to which these two conflicting forces are reflected in the composition of natural communities has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to assess the potential for resource competition and metabolic cooperation in large co-occurring groups (up to 40 members) across thousands of habitats. Our analysis reveals two distinct community types, which are clustered at opposite ends of a spectrum in a trade-off between competition and cooperation. At one end are highly cooperative communities, characterized by smaller genomes and multiple auxotrophies. At the other end are highly competitive communities, which feature larger genomes and overlapping nutritional requirements, and harbour more genes related to antimicrobial activity. The latter are mainly present in soils, whereas the former are found in both free-living and host-associated habitats. Community-scale flux simulations show that, whereas competitive communities can better resist species invasion but not nutrient shift, cooperative communities are susceptible to species invasion but resilient to nutrient change. We also show, by analysing an additional data set, that colonization by probiotic species is positively associated with the presence of cooperative species in the recipient microbiome. Together, our results highlight the bifurcation between competitive and cooperative metabolism in the assembly of natural communities and its implications for community modulation.}

  abstract = {We review approaches to characterize metabolic interactions within microbial communities using Stoichiometric Metabolic Network (SMN) models for applications in environmental and industrial biotechnology. SMN models are computational tools used to evaluate the metabolic engineering potential of various organisms. They have successfully been applied to design and optimize the microbial production of antibiotics, alcohols and amino acids by single strains. To date however, such models have been rarely applied to analyze and control the metabolism of more complex microbial communities. This is largely attributed to the diversity of microbial community functions, metabolisms, and interactions. Here, we firstly review different types of microbial interaction and describe their relevance for natural and engineered environmental processes. Next, we provide a general description of the essential methods of the SMN modeling workflow including the steps of network reconstruction, simulation through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), experimental data gathering, and model calibration. Then we broadly describe and compare four approaches to model microbial interactions using metabolic networks, i.e., (i) lumped networks, (ii) compartment per guild networks, (iii) bilevel optimization simulations, and (iv) dynamic-SMN methods. These approaches can be used to integrate and analyze diverse microbial physiology, ecology and molecular community data. All of them (except the lumped approach) are suitable for incorporating species abundance data but so far they have been used only to model simple communities of two to eight different species. Interactions based on substrate exchange and competition can be directly modeled using the above approaches. However, interactions based on metabolic feedbacks, such as product inhibition and synthropy require extensions to current models, incorporating gene regulation and compounding accumulation mechanisms. SMN models of microbial interactions can be used to analyze complex “omics” data and to infer and optimize metabolic processes. Thereby, SMN models are suitable to capitalize on advances in high-throughput molecular and metabolic data generation. SMN models are starting to be applied to describe microbial interactions during wastewater treatment, in-situ bioremediation, microalgae blooms methanogenic fermentation, and bioplastic production. Despite their current challenges, we envisage that SMN models have future potential for the design and development of novel growth media, biochemical pathways and synthetic microbial associations.},

With the advent of various high-throughput techniques that aim to characterize complete microbial ecosystems (metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics and meta-metabolomics), we propose that the time is ripe to consider molecular systems biology at the ecosystem level (eco-systems biology). Here, we discuss the necessary data types that are required to unite molecular microbiology and ecology to develop an understanding of community function and discuss the potential shortcomings of these approaches.},

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.},

ABSTRACT={<sec>IntroductionTraditional chemical control methods pose a damaging effect on farmland ecology, and their long-term use has led to the development of pest resistance.</sec><sec>MethodsHere, we analyzed the correlations and differences in the microbiome present in the plant and soil of sugarcane cultivars exhibiting different insect resistance to investigate the role played by microbiome in crop insect resistance. We evaluated the microbiome of stems, topsoil, rhizosphere soil, and striped borers obtained from infested stems, as well as soil chemical parameters.</sec><sec>Results and DiscussionResults showed that microbiome diversity was higher in stems of insect-resistant plants, and contrast, lower in the soil of resistant plants, with fungi being more pronounced than bacteria. The microbiome in plant stems was almost entirely derived from the soil. The microbiome of insect-susceptible plants and surrounding soil tended to change towards that of insect-resistant plants after insect damage. Insects’ microbiome was mainly derived from plant stems and partly from the soil. Available potassium showed an extremely significant correlation with soil microbiome. This study validated the role played by the microbiome ecology of plant–soil-insect system in insect resistance and provided a pre-theoretical basis for crop resistance control.</sec>}

abstract = {Insects and other arthropods are central to terrestrial ecosystems. However, data are lacking regarding their global population abundance. We synthesized thousands of evaluations from around 500 sites worldwide, estimating the absolute biomass and abundance of terrestrial arthropods across different taxa and habitats. We found that there are ≈1 × 1019 (twofold uncertainty range) soil arthropods on Earth, ≈95\% of which are soil mites and springtails. The soil contains ≈200 (twofold uncertainty range) million metric tons (Mt) of dry biomass. Termites contribute ≈40\% of the soil biomass, much more than ants at ≈10\%. Our estimate for the global biomass of above-ground arthropods is more uncertain, highlighting a knowledge gap that future research should aim to close. We estimate the combined dry biomass of all terrestrial arthropods at ≈300 Mt (uncertainty range, 100 to 500), similar to the mass of humanity and its livestock. These estimates enhance the quantitative understanding of arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provide an initial holistic benchmark on their decline. Synthesizing local data quantifies arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provides an initial benchmark on their decline.}}

However, the natural histories and distributions of these organisms remain largely undocumented. Delgado-Baquerizo et al. provide a survey of the dominant bacterial taxa found around the world. In soil collections from six continents, they found that only 2\% of bacterial taxa account for nearly half of the soil bacterial communities across the globe. These dominant taxa could be clustered into ecological groups of co-occurring bacteria that share habitat preferences. The findings will allow for a more predictive understanding of soil bacterial diversity and distribution. Science, this issue p. 320 Relatively few soil bacterial taxa dominate terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, with predictable distributions and ecology. The immense diversity of soil bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed soils from 237 locations across six continents and found that only 2\% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the soil bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in soils globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of soil bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a “most wanted” list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based efforts aimed at improving our understanding of soil microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.}}

Little is known about their diversity and distribution at large spatial scales, despite the availability of considerable amounts of local-scale data. Earthworm diversity data, obtained from the primary literature or provided directly by authors, were collated with information on site locations, including coordinates, habitat cover, and soil properties. Datasets were required, at a minimum, to include abundance or biomass of earthworms at a site. Where possible, site-level species lists were included, as well as the abundance and biomass of individual species and ecological groups. This global dataset contains 10,840 sites, with 184 species, from 60 countries and all continents except Antarctica. The data were obtained from 182 published articles, published between 1973 and 2017, and 17 unpublished datasets. Amalgamating data into a single global database will assist researchers in investigating and answering a wide variety of pressing questions, for example, jointly assessing aboveground and belowground biodiversity distributions and drivers of biodiversity change.",

Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning, few quantitative, spatially explicit models of the active belowground community currently exist. In particular, nematodes are the most abundant animals on Earth, filling all trophic levels in the soil food web. Here we use 6,759 georeferenced samples to generate a mechanistic understanding of the patterns of the global abundance of nematodes in the soil and the composition of their functional groups. The resulting maps show that 4.4 {\textpm} 0.64 {\texttimes} 1020 nematodes (with a total biomass of approximately 0.3 gigatonnes) inhabit surface soils across the world, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions (38{\%} of total) than in temperate (24{\%}) or tropical (21{\%}) regions. Regional variations in these global trends also provide insights into local patterns of soil fertility and functioning. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing soil ecological processes in global biogeochemical models and will enable the prediction of elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios.",

ABSTRACT={The persistence of ecological systems in changing environments requires energy, materials, and information. Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: (i) what is information? (ii) how is information related to uncertainty? (iii) what is information processing? (iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.}

    abstract = { Valuing, managing and conserving marine biodiversity and a full range of ecosystem services is at the forefront of research and policy agendas. However, biodiversity is being lost at up to a thousand times the average background rate. Traditional disciplinary and siloed conservation approaches are not able to tackle this massive loss of biodiversity because they generally ignore or overlook the interactive and dynamic nature of ecosystems processes, limiting their predictability. To conserve marine biodiversity, we must assess the interactions and impacts among biodiversity and ecosystem services (BD-ES). The scaling up in complexity from single species to entire communities is necessary, albeit challenging, for a deeper understanding of how ecosystem services relate to biodiversity and the roles species have in ecosystem service provision. These interactions are challenging to map, let alone fully assess, but network and system-based approaches provide a powerful way to progress beyond those limitations. Here, we introduce a conceptual multi-layered network approach to understanding how ecosystem services supported by biodiversity drive the total service provision, how different stressors impact BD-ES and where conservation efforts should be placed to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Integrative research perspectives on marine conservation’. }

Yet such knowledge is crucial in deciphering ecological and evolutionary processes and in managing global change. In this review, we propose a conceptual and cyber-infrastructure framework for refining species distributional knowledge that is novel in its ability to mobilize and integrate diverse types of data such that their collective strengths overcome individual weaknesses. The ultimate aim is a public, online, quality-vetted ‘Map of Life’ that for every species integrates and visualizes available distributional knowledge, while also facilitating user feedback and dynamic biodiversity analyses. First milestones toward such an infrastructure have now been implemented.}

                   methods to uncover key micro-organisms and processes
                   driving biogeochemical cycling in natural ecosystems.
                   Databases dedicated to depicting biogeochemical
                   pathways (for example, metabolism of
                   dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is an
                   abundant organosulfur compound) from
                   metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data are rarely seen.
                   Additionally, a recognized normalization model to
                   estimate the relative abundance and environmental
                   importance of pathways from metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic data has not been organized to
                   date. These limitations impact the ability to
                   accurately relate key microbial-driven biogeochemical
                   processes to differences in environmental conditions.
                   Thus, an easy-to-use, specialized tool that infers
                   and visually compares the potential for
                   biogeochemical processes, including DMSP cycling, is
                   urgently required. To solve these issues, we
                   developed DiTing, a tool wrapper to infer and compare
                   biogeochemical pathways among a set of given
                   metagenomic or metatranscriptomic reads in one step,
                   based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
                   (KEGG) and a manually created DMSP cycling gene
                   database. Accurate and specific formulae for over 100
                   pathways were developed to calculate their relative
                   abundance. Output reports detail the relative
                   abundance of biogeochemical pathways in both text and
                   graphical format. DiTing was applied to simulated
                   metagenomic data and resulted in consistent genetic
                   features of simulated benchmark genomic data.
                   Subsequently, when applied to natural metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic data from hydrothermal vents and
                   the Tara Ocean project, the functional profiles
                   predicted by DiTing were correlated with
                   environmental condition changes. DiTing can now be
                   confidently applied to wider metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic datasets, and it is available at
                   https://github.com/xuechunxu/DiTing.},

                   indispensable for modern marine research, providing
                   support to an increasing number and diversity of
                   users. Pairing with the impetus offered by
                   high-throughput methods to key areas such as
                   non-model organism studies, their operation
                   continuously evolves to meet the corresponding
                   computational challenges. Here, we present a Tier 2
                   (regional) HPC facility, operating for over a decade
                   at the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology,
                   and Aquaculture of the Hellenic Centre for Marine
                   Research in Greece. Strategic choices made in design
                   and upgrades aimed to strike a balance between depth
                   (the need for a few high-memory nodes) and breadth (a
                   number of slimmer nodes), as dictated by the
                   idiosyncrasy of the supported research. Qualitative
                   computational requirement analysis of the latter
                   revealed the diversity of marine fields, methods, and
                   approaches adopted to translate data into knowledge.
                   In addition, hardware and software architectures,
                   usage statistics, policy, and user management aspects
                   of the facility are presented. Drawing upon the last
                   decade's experience from the different levels of
                   operation of the Institute of Marine Biology,
                   Biotechnology, and Aquaculture HPC facility, a number
                   of lessons are presented; these have contributed to
                   the facility's future directions in light of emerging
                   distribution technologies (e.g., containers) and
                   Research Infrastructure evolution. In combination
                   with detailed knowledge of the facility usage and its

@inproceedings{page_text-mining_2019,
	abstract = {The taxonomic literature is one of the largest resources of information on biodiversity, both current and in the past. Unlike many scientific disciplines this literature remains perpetually relevant as successive taxonomic work builds upon those earlier foundations. Projects such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) have greatly increased access to that literature, as have numerous independent digitisation efforts by museums, herbaria, and publishers. But the focus of this access has been human readers, with limited use of text mining tools, mostly focussed on extracting taxonomic names. This talk explores other kinds of data that can be extracted from text on BHL and elsewhere, focusing on taxonomic names, geographic localities and specimen codes in the context of the BioStor project (https://biostor.org, Page 2011).
The problem of finding taxonomic names in text has been well studied (e.g., Akella et al. 2012), and new BHL content is continuously indexed by names. Despite this, there is only weak linkage between taxonomic name databases and BHL. Even projects that create these links (e.g., BioNames, Page 2013) do not enable links in the reverse direction. In other words, a BHL reader is unaware whether the appearance of a name on a page is the first publication of that name, nor are they told of the fate of a name in subsequent research. The absence of these links reduces the value of BHL to working taxonomists.
In addition to taxonomic names, a typical taxonomic paper often contains specimen codes. Extracting these from text and linking them to digital representations, such as occurrence records in GBIF, opens up the possibility to provide detailed provenance for occurrence data, as well as citation-based metrics for the utility of natural history collections.
Taxonomic papers are also often rich in geographic information. A simple method for extracting locality information from text is to search for latitude and longitude coordinates, and BioStor currently does this. To date some 83,000 individual point localities have been extracted (Fig. 1 ). These are used to provide a simple geographic search interface in BioStor, and are also harvested by JournalMap (Karl et al. 2013). But these localities are not linked to the original location in the source text, nor are they linked to any associated specimens, so they cannot be interpreted as occurrences that could be harvested by GBIF. If the goal is to contribute to GBIF then we need tools that can parse locality information and link that to associated specimens.
A general framework for handling data on taxonomic names, specimens, and geographic localities in text is to treat them as annotations (Batista-Navarro et al. 2017). By modelling annotations using the Web Annotation Data Model (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ ) we can incorporate these annotations into biodiversity knowledge graphs (Page 2016). We can also combine these annotations with new standards for describing digitised content, such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF, https://iiif.io). The implications of this approach for developing new interfaces to the biodiversity literature will be discussed.},

We report on three experiments measuring the extent to which  curation can be speeded up with assistance from Natural Language Processing  (NLP), together with subjective feedback from curators on the usability of a  curation tool that integrates NLP hypotheses for protein-protein interactions  (PPIs). In our curation scenario, we found that a maximum speed-up of 1/3 in  curation time can be expected if NLP output is perfectly accurate. The preference  of one curator for consistent NLP output and output with high recall needs to be  confirmed in a larger study with several curators.},

	abstract = {Maps depict natural and human-induced changes on earth at a fine resolution for large areas and over long periods of time. In addition, maps---especially historical maps---are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of digital map archives have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from archived images of maps (digital map processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information that can be used in spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image. This article presents an overview of existing map processing techniques, with the goal of bringing together the past and current research efforts in this interdisciplinary field, to characterize the advances that have been made, and to identify future research directions and opportunities.},

@article{sautter_semi-automated_2007,

Digitized  biosystematics literature requires a very precise and fine grained markup in order  to be useful for detailed search, data linkage and mining. However, manual markup on  sentence level and below is cumbersome and time consuming. In this paper, we present  and evaluate the GoldenGATE editor, which is designed for the special needs of  marking up OCR output with XML. It is built in order to support the user in this  process as far as possible: Its functionality ranges from easy, intuitive tagging  through markup conversion to dynamic binding of configurable plug-ins provided by  third parties. Our evaluation shows that marking up an OCR document using GoldenGATE  is three to four times faster than with an off-the-shelf XML editor like XML-Spy.  Using domain-specific NLP-based plug-ins, these numbers are even higher.},

@article{pyle_towards_2016,
	abstract = {For more than 250 years, the taxonomic enterprise has remained almost unchanged. Certainly, the tools of the trade have improved: months-long journeys aboard sailing ships have been reduced to hours aboard jet airplanes; advanced technology allows humans to access environments that were once utterly inaccessible; GPS has replaced crude maps; digital hi-resolution imagery provides far more accurate renderings of organisms that even the best commissioned artists of a century ago; and primitive candle-lit microscopes have been replaced by an array of technologies ranging from scanning electron microscopy to DNA sequencing. But the basic paradigm remains the same. Perhaps the most revolutionary change of all - which we are still in the midst of, and which has not yet been fully realized - is the means by which taxonomists manage and communicate the information of their trade. The rapid evolution in recent decades of computer database management software, and of information dissemination via the Internet, have both dramatically improved the potential for streamlining the entire taxonomic process. Unfortunately, the potential still largely exceeds the reality. The vast majority of taxonomic information is either not yet digitized, or digitized in a form that does not allow direct and easy access. Moreover, the information that is easily accessed in digital form is not yet seamlessly interconnected. In an effort to bring reality closer to potential, a loose affiliation of major taxonomic resources, including GBIF, the Encyclopedia of Life, NBII, Catalog of Life, ITIS, IPNI, ICZN, Index Fungorum, and many others have been crafting a "Global Names Architecture" (GNA). The intention of the GNA is not to replace any of the existing taxonomic data initiatives, but rather to serve as a dynamic index to interconnect them in a way that streamlines the entire taxonomic enterprise: from gathering specimens in the field, to publication of new taxa and related data.},

It is diagnosed that these changes are bound up with multi-media and multi-perspective facilities of annotation tools, in particular when considering virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, their potential ubiquitous use, and the exploitation of externally trained natural language pre-processing methods. Such developments potentially lead to a dynamic and exploratory heuristic construction of the annotation process. With TextAnnotator an annotation suite is introduced which focuses on multi-mediality and multi-perspectivity with an interoperable set of task-specific annotation modules (e.g., for word classification, rhetorical structures, dependency trees, semantic roles, and more) and their linkage to VR and mobile implementations. The basic architecture and usage of TextAnnotator is described and related to the above mentioned shifts in the field.},

Such data are now being collected, formatted and disseminated by MedOBIS (the Mediterranean Ocean Biogeographic Information System) initiative involving Greece, the Ukraine and Israel (test version available at: www.medobis.org). The aim is to develop a taxon-based biogeography database and online data server with links to survey and satellite environmental data. MedOBIS is currently undergoing 4 stages of development, namely, data assembly, formatting, analysis and dissemination. The primary features of the MedOBIS application are its offline GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data formatting capabilities and its online Java- and JavaScript-enabling data server with taxon-based search, mapping and data downloading capabilities. It is an independent source of biological and environmental data, as well as an online GIS tool designed to facilitate access to historical and current data by marine researchers. As more data become available and are inserted into the system, MedOBIS will function as the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea node of EurOBIS (the European node of the international OBIS initiative, part of the \&\#145;Census of Marine Life\&\#146;).},

@article{mora_how_2011,
	abstract = {Author Summary Knowing the number of species on Earth is one of the most basic yet elusive questions in science. Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) species globally, of which ∼2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86\% of the species on Earth, and 91\% in the ocean, still await description. Closing this knowledge gap will require a renewed interest in exploration and taxonomy, and a continuing effort to catalogue existing biodiversity data in publicly available databases.},

@article{martin_miguez_european_2019,
	abstract = {Marine data are needed for many purposes: for acquiring a better scientific understanding of the marine environment, but also, increasingly, as marine knowledge for decision making as well as developing products and services supporting economic growth. Data must be of sufficient quality to meet the specific users' needs. It must also be accessible in a timely manner. And yet, despite being critical, this timely access to known-quality data proves challenging. Europe's marine data have traditionally been collected by a myriad of entities with the result that much of our data are scattered throughout unconnected databases and repositories. Even when data are available, they are often not compatible, making the sharing of the information and data aggregation particularly challenging. In this paper, we present how the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet) has developed over the last decade to tackle these issues. Today, EMODnet is comprised of more than 150 organizations which gather marine data, metadata, and data products and make them more easily accessible for a wider range of users. EMODnet currently consists of seven sub-portals: bathymetry, geology, physics, chemistry, biology, seabed habitats, and human activities. In addition, Sea-basin Checkpoints have been established to assess the observation capacity in the North Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Baltic, Artic, and Black Sea. The Checkpoints identify whether the observation infrastructure in Europe meets the needs of users by undertaking a number of challenges. To complement this, a Data Ingestion Service has been set up to tackle the problem of the wealth of marine data that remain unavailable, by reaching out to data holders, explaining the benefits of sharing their data and offering a support service to assist them in releasing their data and making them available through EMODnet. The EMODnet Central Portal (www.emodnet.eu) provides a single point of access to these services, which are free to access and use. The strategic vision of EMODnet in the next decade is also presented, together with key focal areas toward a more user-oriented service, including EMODnet for business, internationalization for global users, and stakeholder engagement to connect the diverse communities across the marine knowledge value chain.},

Data sharing has a long history in many domains such as oceanography and the biodiversity sciences (e.g., taxonomic data and museum specimens), but has emerged relatively recently in the ecological sciences. A review of several of the large international and national ecological research programs that have emerged since the mid-1900s highlights the initial failures and more recent successes as well as the underlying causes---from a near absence of effective policies to the emergence of community and data sharing policies coupled with the development and adoption of data and metadata standards and enabling tools. Sociocultural change and the move towards more open science have evolved more rapidly over the past two decades in response to new requirements set forth by governmental organizations, publishers and professional societies. As the scientific culture has changed so has the cyberinfrastructure landscape. The introduction of community-based data repositories, data and metadata standards, software tools, persistent identifiers, and federated search and discovery have all helped promulgate data sharing. Nevertheless, there are many challenges and opportunities especially as we move towards more open science. Cyberinfrastructure challenges include a paucity of easy-to-use metadata management systems, significant difficulties in assessing data quality and provenance, and an absence of analytical and visualization approaches that facilitate data integration and harmonization. Challenges and opportunities abound in the sociocultural arena where funders, researchers, and publishers all have a stake in clarifying policies, roles and responsibilities, as well as in incentivizing data sharing. A set of best practices and examples of software tools are presented that can enable research transparency, reproducibility and new knowledge by facilitating idea generation, research planning, data management and the dissemination of data and results.},

	abstract = {The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL, http://eol.org) aims to provide unprecedented global access to a broad range of information about life on Earth. It currently contains 3.5 million distinct pages for taxa and provides content for 1.3 million of those pages. The content is primarily contributed by EOL content partners (providers) that have a more limited geographic, taxonomic or topical scope. EOL aggregates these data and automatically integrates them based on associated scientific names and other classification information. EOL also provides interfaces for curation and direct content addition. All materials in EOL are either in the public domain or licensed under a Creative Commons license. In addition to the web interface, EOL is also accessible through an Application Programming Interface.
In this paper, we review recent developments added for Version 2 of the web site and subsequent releases through Version 2.2, which have made EOL more engaging, personal, accessible and internationalizable. We outline the core features and technical architecture of the system. We summarize milestones achieved so far by EOL to present results of the current system implementation and establish benchmarks upon which to judge future improvements.
We have shown that it is possible to successfully integrate large amounts of descriptive biodiversity data from diverse sources into a robust, standards-based, dynamic, and scalable infrastructure. Increasing global participation and the emergence of EOL-powered applications demonstrate that EOL is becoming a significant resource for anyone interested in biological diversity.},

This translation facilitates the understanding of biological processes under normal or disease conditions. Researchers aiming to identify the similarities and differences between organisms at the molecular level need resources collecting multi-organism tissue expression data. We have developed a database of gene--tissue associations in human, mouse, rat and pig by integrating multiple sources of evidence: transcriptomics covering all four species and proteomics (human only), manually curated and mined from the scientific literature. Through a scoring scheme, these associations are made comparable across all sources of evidence and across organisms. Furthermore, the scoring produces a confidence score assigned to each of the associations. The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly accessible through a user-friendly web interface and as part of the STRING app for Cytoscape. In addition, we analyzed the agreement between datasets, across and within organisms, and identified that the agreement is mainly affected by the quality of the datasets rather than by the technologies used or organisms compared.Database URL: http://tissues.jensenlab.org/},

The identification of named biological entities in text is a central and difficult task. We have developed an efficient algorithm and implementation of a dictionary-based approach to named entity recognition, which we here use to identify names of species and other taxa in text. The tool, SPECIES, is more than an order of magnitude faster and as accurate as existing tools. The precision and recall was assessed both on an existing gold-standard corpus and on a new corpus of 800 abstracts, which were manually annotated after the development of the tool. The corpus comprises abstracts from journals selected to represent many taxonomic groups, which gives insights into which types of organism names are hard to detect and which are easy. Finally, we have tagged organism names in the entire Medline database and developed a web resource, ORGANISMS, that makes the results accessible to the broad community of biologists. The SPECIES software is open source and can be downloaded from http://species.jensenlab.org along with dictionary files and the manually annotated goldstandard corpus. The ORGANISMS web resource can be found at http://organisms.jensenlab.org.},

@article{le_guillarme_taxonerd_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Easy access to multi-taxa information (e.g. distribution, traits, diet) in the scientific literature is essential to understand, map and predict all-inclusive biodiversity. Tools are needed to automatically extract useful information from the ever-growing corpus of ecological texts and feed this information to open data repositories. A prerequisite is the ability to recognise mentions of taxa in text, a special case of named entity recognition (NER). In recent years, deep learning-based NER systems have become ubiquitous, yielding state-of-the-art results in the general and biomedical domains. However, no such tool is available to ecologists wishing to extract information from the biodiversity literature. We propose a new tool called TaxoNERD that provides deep neural network (DNN) models to recognise taxon mentions in ecological documents. To achieve high performance, these models usually need to be trained on a large corpus of manually annotated text. Creating such a corpus is a laborious and costly process, with the result that manually annotated corpora in the ecological domain tend to be too small to learn an accurate DNN model from scratch. To address this issue, we leverage existing models pretrained on large biomedical corpora using transfer learning. The performance of our models is evaluated on four corpora and compared to the most popular taxonomic entity recognition tools. Our experiments suggest that existing taxonomic NER tools are not suited to the extraction of ecological information from text as they performed poorly on ecologically oriented corpora, either because they do not take account of the variability of taxon naming practices or because they do not generalise well to the ecological domain. Conversely, a domain-specific DNN-based tool like TaxoNERD outperformed the other approaches on an ecological information extraction task. Efforts are needed to raise ecological information extraction to the same level of performance as its biomedical counterpart. One promising direction is to leverage the huge corpus of unlabelled ecological texts to learn a language representation model that could benefit downstream tasks. These efforts could be highly beneficial to ecologists on the long term.},

@article{lyal_digitising_2016,
	abstract = {By digitising legacy taxonomic literature using XML mark-up the contents become accessible to other taxonomic and nomenclatural information systems. Appropriate schemas need to be interoperable with other sectorial schemas, atomise to appropriate content elements and carry appropriate metadata to, for example, enable algorithmic assessment of availability of a name under the Code. Legacy (and new) literature delivered in this fashion will become part of a global taxonomic resource from which users can extract tailored content to meet their particular needs, be they nomenclatural, taxonomic, faunistic or other.
To date, most digitisation of taxonomic literature has led to a more or less simple digital copy of a paper original -- the output of the many efforts has effectively been an electronic copy of a traditional library. While this has increased accessibility of publications through internet access, the means by which many scientific papers are indexed and located is much the same as with traditional libraries. OCR and born-digital papers allow use of web search engines to locate instances of taxon names and other terms, but OCR efficiency in recognising taxonomic names is still relatively poor, people's ability to use search engines effectively is mixed, and many papers cannot be searched directly. Instead of building digital analogues of traditional publications, we should consider what properties we require of future taxonomic information access. Ideally the content of each new digital publication should be accessible in the context of all previous published data, and the user able to retrieve nomenclatural, taxonomic and other data / information in the form required without having to scan all of the original papers and extract target content manually. This opens the door to dynamic linking of new content with extant systems: automatic population and updating of taxonomic catalogues, ZooBank and faunal lists, all descriptions of a taxon and its children instantly accessible with a single search, comparison of classifications used in different publications, and so on. A means to do this is through marking up content into XML, and the more atomised the mark-up the greater the possibilities for data retrieval and integration. Mark-up requires XML that accommodates the required content elements and is interoperable with other XML schemas, and there are now several written to do this, particularly TaxPub, taxonX and taXMLit, the last of these being the most atomised. We now need to automate this process as far as possible. Manual and automatic data and information retrieval is demonstrated by projects such as INOTAXA and Plazi. As we move to creating and using taxonomic products through the power of the internet, we need to ensure the output, while satisfying in its production the requirements of the Code, is fit for purpose in the future.},

Over the last decade, marine scientists from different disciplines have engaged in the emerging field of marine historical ecology to reconstruct past changes in the sea. Here we review the diversity of approaches used and resulting patterns of historical changes in large marine mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Across 256 reviewed records, exploited populations declined 89\% from historical abundance levels (range: 11--100\%). In many cases, long-term fluctuations are related to climate variation, rapid declines to overexploitation and recent recoveries to conservation measures. These emerging historical patterns offer new insights into past ecosystems, and provide important context for contemporary ocean management.},

What is less widely known is that insights from MHE have made headway into being applied within the context of present-day and long-term management and policy. This study draws attention to the applied value of MHE. We demonstrate that a broad knowledge base exists with potential for management application and advice, including the development of baselines and reference levels. Using a number of case studies from around the world, we showcase the value of historical ecology in understanding change and emphasize how it either has already informed management or has the potential to do so soon. We discuss these case studies in a context of the science--policy interface around six themes that are frequently targeted by current marine and maritime policies: climate change, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem structure, habitat integrity, food security, and human governance. We encourage science--policy bodies to actively engage with contributions from MHE, as well-informed policy decisions need to be framed within the context of historical reference points and past resource or ecosystem changes.},

Further, it defines and compares several routes for data publishing, namely as (1) supplementary files to research articles, which may be made available directly by the publisher, or (2) published in a specialized open data repository with a link to it from the research article, or (3) as a data paper, i.e., a specific, stand-alone publication describing a particular dataset or a collection of datasets, or (4) integrated narrative and data publishing through online import/download of data into/from manuscripts, as provided by the Biodiversity Data Journal.
The paper also contains detailed instructions on how to prepare and peer review data intended for publication, listed under the Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers, respectively. Special attention is given to existing standards, protocols and tools to facilitate data publishing, such as the Integrated Publishing Toolkit of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF IPT) and the DarwinCore Archive (DwC-A).

Large-scale mining of information from the literature is necessary if biology is to transform into a data-driven science. A computer can handle the volume but cannot make sense of the language. This paper reviews and discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to extract information from systematic literature. NLP algorithms have been used for decades, but require special development for application in the biological realm due to the special nature of the language. Many tools exist for biological information extraction (cellular processes, taxonomic names, and morphological characters), but none have been applied life wide and most still require testing and development. Progress has been made in developing algorithms for automated annotation of taxonomic text, identification of taxonomic names in text, and extraction of morphological character information from taxonomic descriptions. This manuscript will briefly discuss the key steps in applying information extraction tools to enhance biodiversity science.},

	abstract = {Abstract The RECovery of Logbooks and International Marine data (RECLAIM) project is a concerted, international effort to facilitate and encourage the recovery?through imaging and digitisation?of archived marine weather observations, platform and instrumental metadata and historical documentation, from many different countries. Non-instrumental observations of wind and weather have been recorded in ships' logbooks for hundreds of years, augmented by systematic instrumental observations of sea surface and air temperatures, barometric pressure and other meteorological (and oceanographic) elements largely since the mid-nineteenth century. Once digitised, these data are widely useful for climate studies and other avenues of scientific research?including oceanography, fisheries, maritime history and ecology?thus improvements seeking to address gaps and weaknesses in the currently available data record can be of major importance. In addition to documenting and prioritising archived ship logbook records for imaging and digitisation in support of that goal, RECLAIM provides expert assistance in the interpretation of historical marine records in relation to navigation, observational practices and recording. Since the project inception in 2005, RECLAIM has facilitated, for example, recovery of logbooks of the Dutch and English East India Companies in the nineteenth century, and of the British Royal Navy of the twentieth century. Currently the project website includes reference lists, rescued UK and US marine documents, extensive UK archive reports and detailed inventories of ship movements. A variety of other developing international linkages are discussed, including to Chilean, Dutch, French, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and US historical records. ?

@article{vandepitte_fishing_2015,
	abstract = {Being able to assess the quality and level of completeness of data has become indispensable in marine biodiversity research, especially when dealing with large databases that typically compile data from a variety of sources. Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records---passing a specific combination of these QC steps---is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves. Through LifeWatch, users can already upload their own data and check them against a selection of the here described quality control procedures.Database URL : www.eurobis.org ( www.iobis.org ; www.emodnet-biology.eu/ )},

Historical collections are particularly rich in types and also represent a model of the biodiversity of marine life at the time of the collection, often centuries ago. The taxonomic and systematic importance of collections is well appreciated, as is the significance of time series of data in this period of anthropogenic environmental change. The application of new techniques increases the value of collected material even further, for example, molecular biology techniques allowing the recognition of new (often cryptic) taxa and their distributions, and stable isotope analyses releasing information on past and present ontogenies, geographical distributions and diets. Moreover the new era of information technology with associated digitization enables the release of the information stored in the collections to the scientists of the world.},

They underpin biological taxonomy but the data they contain have many other uses in the biological and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, from their conception they are almost entirely documented on paper, either as labels attached to the specimens or in catalogues linked with catalogue numbers. In order to make the best use of these data and to improve the findability of these specimens, these data must be transcribed digitally and made to conform to standards, so that these data are also interoperable and reusable.Through various digitization projects, the authors have experimented with transcription by volunteers, expert technicians, scientists, commercial transcription services and automated systems. We have also been consumers of specimen data for taxonomical, biogeographical and ecological research. In this paper, we draw from our experiences to make specific recommendations to improve transcription data. The paper is split into two sections. We first address issues related to database implementation with relevance to data transcription, namely versioning, annotation, unknown and incomplete data and issues related to language. We then focus on particular data types that are relevant to biological collection specimens, namely nomenclature, dates, geography, collector numbers and uniquely identifying people. We make recommendations to standards organizations, software developers, data scientists and transcribers to improve these data with the specific aim of improving interoperability between collection datasets.},

	abstract = {Place name mentions in text may have more than one potential referent (e.g. Peru, the country vs. Peru, the city in Indiana). The Edinburgh Language Technology Group (LTG) has developed the Edinburgh Geoparser, a system that can automatically recognise place name mentions in text and disambiguate them with respect to a gazetteer. The recognition step is required to identify location mentions in a given piece of text. The subsequent disambiguation step, generally referred to as georesolution, grounds location mentions to their corresponding gazetteer entries with latitude and longitude values, for example, to visualise them on a map. Geoparsing is not only useful for mapping purposes but also for making document collections more accessible as it can provide additional metadata about the geographical content of documents. Combined with other information mined from text such as person names and date expressions, complex relations between such pieces of information can be identified. The Edinburgh Geoparser can be used with several gazetteers including Unlock and GeoNames to process a variety of input texts. The original version of the Geoparser was a demonstrator configured for modern text. Since then, it has been adapted to georeference historic and ancient text collections as well as modern-day newspaper text.1,2,3,4 Currently, the LTG is involved in three research projects applying the Geoparser to historical text collections of very different types and for a variety of end-user applications.

It is presented as a Linked Open Dataset generated from scientific literature. OpenBiodiv encompasses data extracted from more than 5000 scholarly articles published by Pensoft and many more taxonomic treatments extracted by Plazi from journals of other publishers. The data from both sources are converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and integrated in a graph database using the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and an RDF version of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomic backbone.

@article{herrmann_building_2020,
	abstract = {In 2016 the United Nations published the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It quickly became clear that information is a catalyst for almost every goal, and enhancing information access is necessary to achieve and ultimately improve global community life. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is therefore an invaluable resource for redressing inequallities as it provides information and literature as an open access library. But there are also still hurdles to overcome to ensure information for all. In the following, we will focus on technical developments outlined in the BHL's technical strategy. One challenge is the different digital infrastructures resulting in limited access to the web-based BHL. In 2019, only 53.6\% of the global population accessed the internet (Clement 2020). Even if the reasons for this are diverse, we assume that network coverage is a problem we have to address. One focus of the BHL's technical strategy is to support and provide solutions for remote areas with no or low bandwidth connection. Furthermore the technical strategy focuses on the provision of services and tools for various usage scenarios by implementing a responsive design. In 2019, mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, accounted for 54\% of all page views worldwide (Poleshova 2020). Even though a differentiated view must be taken of which devices are used for which scenario, it can be assumed that mobile devices will be used more frequently in everyday scientific life, for example in field research. By a responsive design of the BHL website, we address this trend in technological development and media usage in order to remain a user-friendly research infrastructure in the future.Another challenge is the multilingual user experience. The multilingualism of BHL will become an essential part of the technological development to address the global biodiversity community and to reflect the worldwide biodiversity research. We aim to achieve this through a multilingual user interface and multilingual search options. The services and tools mentioned above require a high quality database, especially machine-readable text. The improvement of optical character recognition (OCR) is fundamentally important for further technological developments. Good OCR results ensure a comprehensive search in the entire corpus, and with further technological possibilities, data could be added that goes beyond the pure text. Currently taxonomic names are parsed and linked to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), giving users the opportunities to search for taxonomic synonyms. In the future, this enrichment could be used for more data, such as collection data, geographical names, etc. In the challenge of improving and enriching the data, the BHL will depend on its large community, for example in crowdsourcing transcription projects. In order to reach those objectives and to continue to offer BHL's services to the global community in the best possible way, we need to monitor best practices in digital library and bioinformatics developments and implement them wherever possible. The BHL consortium will have to rely on partnerships and collaborations to fulfill this plan. We are therefore looking into cooperation with other consortia and will also explore alternative technological development models where third parties would develop apps and services from open BHL data. Taking all the mentioned approaches into account, the BHL will develop from a mainly literature library to a data library. It will be our task to create open source software and tools, like better APIs, to support the re-use of the data. This goes along with the aim to increase the awareness of the BHL within the biodiversity community as it is set in the BHL Strategic Plan 2020-2025 (Biodiversity Heritage Library 2020).To draw a conclusion, the BHL's technical strategy focuses on five main objectives to advance information access for the biodiversity community worldwide:  Improve global awareness and accessibilityEnhance machine-readability of BHL content for data re-useIdentify resources needed to achieve the technical planEnsure continued priorities and leadership for technical infrastructureImplement BHL 2020 Technical Priority Plan (Biodiversity Heritage Library 2020).The principle of our work is to adapt BHL to current technological, scientific and social developments in order to provide the global community with the best possible research tool for biodiversity research and to enhance the achievement of the SDGs.},

We employ these case studies as strategic exemplars, supplemented with existing research on collaboration in biology, to expose the different motives, organisational forms and social dynamics underpinning contemporary large-scale collaborations in biology and their relations to historical patterns of collaboration in the life sciences.

The future of OBIS will be in working toward an open and inviting process of co-developing OBIS as a global networked open-source data system that will enable the community to organize, document, and contribute analytical codes that interface directly with OBIS, provide analyses, and share results.

@article{levin_problem_1992,
	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

@article{poelen_global_2014,
	abstract = {An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

@article{dimitrova_pensoft_2020,
	abstract = {IntroductionDigitisation of biodiversity knowledge from collections, scholarly literature and various research documents is an ongoing mission of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) community. Organisations such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library make historical biodiversity literature openly available and develop tools to allow biodiversity data reuse and interoperability. For instance, Plazi transforms free text into machine-readable formats and extracts collection data and feeds it into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and other aggregators. All of these digitisation workflows require a lot of effort to develop and implement in practice. In essence, what these digitisation activities entail are the mapping of free text to concepts from recognised vocabularies or ontologies in order to make the content understandable to computers. AimWe aim to address the problem of mapping free text to ontological terms ("strings to things") with our tool for text-to-ontology mapping: the Pensoft Annotator.Methods \& ImplementationThe Annotator is a web application that performs direct text matching to terms from any ontology or vocabulary list given as input to the Annotator. The term 'ontology' is used loosely here and means a collection of terms and their synonyms, where terms are uniquely identified via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The Annotator accepts any of the following ontology formats (e.g. OBO, OWL, RDF/XML, etc.) but does not require the existence of a proper ontology structure (logical statements). We use the ROBOT command line tool to convert any of these formats to JSON. After the upload of a new ontology, the Annotator processes the ontology terms by normalising all exact synonyms and by removing all of the other synonyms (related, narrow and broad synonyms). This is done to limit the number of false positive matches and to preserve the semantic similarity between the matched ontology term and the text.After matching the words in the input text and the ontology term labels, the Pensoft Annotator returns a table of matched ontology terms including the following fields: the identifier of the ontology term, the ontology term label or the label of the synonym, the starting position of the matched term in the text, the term context (words surrounding the matched term in the text), the type of ontology term (class or property), the ontology from which the matched term originates and the number of times a given term is mentioned in the text. The Pensoft Annotator allows simultaneous annotation with multiple ontologies. To better visualise the exact ontology from which a matching term has been found, the terms are highlighted in different colour depending on the ontology. The Pensoft Annotator is also accessible programmatically via an Application Programming Interface (API), documented at https://annotator.pensoft.net/api.Discussion \& Use CasesThe Pensoft Annotator provides functionalities that will aid the transformation of free text to collections of semantic resources. However, it still requires expert knowledge to use as the ontologies need to be selected carefully. Some false positive matches from the annotation are possible because we do not perform semantic analysis of the texts. False negatives are also possible since there might be different word forms of ontology terms, which are not direct matches to them (e.g. 'wolf' and 'wolves'). For this reason, matched terms can be reviewed and removed from the results within the web interface of the Pensoft Annotator. After removal of terms, they will not be present in the downloaded results. The Pensoft Annotator can be used to annotate biodiversity and taxonomic literature to help with the extraction of biodiversity knowledge (e.g. species habitat preferences, species interaction data, localities, biogeographic data). The existence of some domain and taxon-specific ontologies, such as the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology, provides further opportunities for context-specific annotation. Semantic analysis of unstructured texts could be applied in addition to ontology annotation to improve the accuracy of ontology term matching and to filter out mismatched terms. Annotation of structured or semi-structured text (e.g. tables) can be done with better success. A recent example demonstrates the use of the Annotator to extract biotic interactions from tables (Dimitrova et al. 2020). The Annotator could also be used for ontology analysis and comparison. Annotation of text can help to discover gaps in ontologies as well as inaccurate synonyms. For instance, a certain word could be recognised as an ontology term match because it is an exact synonym in the ontology but in reality it might be more accurate to mark it as a related synonym. In addition, annotation with multiple ontologies can help to elucidate links between ontologies.},

	abstract = {Old maps are increasingly used as a source for historical research. This is a consequence of the increased availability of old maps in digital form, of the emergence of user-friendly Geographical Information Systems, and of a heightened awareness of the unique information stored in old maps. As with every source for historical studies, when old maps are georeferenced and information is extracted for historical research, the accuracy and reliability of the geometric and semantic information must be assessed. In this paper, a method based on a series of geometric transformations is presented, which transforms control points of a modern reference map to the coordinate system of an old map. Based on these transformed points, the planimetric and geodetic accuracy of the old map can be computationally analyzed and various visualizations of space deformation can be generated. The results are graphical representations of map distortion, such as distortion grids or displacement vectors, as well as statistical and geodetic measures describing the map geometry (e.g., map scale, rotation angle, and map projection). The visualizations help to assess the geometric accuracy of historical geographical information before using the data for geo-historical studies. The visualizations can also provide valuable information to the map historian about the history of a particular map and its creation.},

@article{arnaboldi_text_2020,
	abstract = {Biological knowledgebases rely on expert biocuration of the research literature to maintain up-to-date collections of data organized in machine-readable form. To enter information into knowledgebases, curators need to follow three steps: (i) identify papers containing relevant data, a process called triaging; (ii) recognize named entities; and (iii) extract and curate data in accordance with the underlying data models. WormBase (WB), the authoritative repository for research data on Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes, uses text mining (TM) to semi-automate its curation pipeline. In addition, WB engages its community, via an Author First Pass (AFP) system, to help recognize entities and classify data types in their recently published papers. In this paper, we present a new WB AFP system that combines TM and AFP into a single application to enhance community curation. The system employs string-searching algorithms and statistical methods (e.g. support vector machines (SVMs)) to extract biological entities and classify data types, and it presents the results to authors in a web form where they validate the extracted information, rather than enter it de novo as the previous form required. With this new system, we lessen the burden for authors, while at the same time receive valuable feedback on the performance of our TM tools. The new user interface also links out to specific structured data submission forms, e.g. for phenotype or expression pattern data, giving the authors the opportunity to contribute a more detailed curation that can be incorporated into WB with minimal curator review. Our approach is generalizable and could be applied to additional knowledgebases that would like to engage their user community in assisting with the curation. In the five months succeeding the launch of the new system, the response rate has been comparable with that of the previous AFP version, but the quality and quantity of the data received has greatly improved.},

Finally, it is maintained that science studies as a discipline is able to (and should) make a significant contribution to the design of robust and flexible databases which recognize this performative character of infrastructure.},

	abstract = {In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used. Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.},

@article{rivera-quiroz_extracting_2019,
	abstract = {Traditional taxonomic publications have served as a biological data repository accumulating vast amounts of data on species diversity, geographical and temporal distributions, ecological interactions, taxonomic relations, among many other types of information. However, the fragmented nature of taxonomic literature has made this data difficult to access and use to its full potential. Current anthropogenic impact on biodiversity demands faster knowledge generation, but also making better use of what we already have. This could help us make better-informed decisions about conservation and resources management.
  In past years, several efforts have been made to make taxonomic literature more mobilized and accessible. These include online publications, open access journals, the digitization of old paper literature and improved availability through online specialized repositories such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and the World Spider Catalog (WSC), among others. Although easy to share, PDF publications still have most of their biodiversity data embedded in strings of text making them less dynamic and more difficult or impossible to read and analyze without a human interpreter. Recently developed tools as GoldenGATE-Imagine (GGI) allow transforming PDFs in XML files that extract and categorize taxonomically relevant data. These data can then be aggregated in databases such as Plazi TreatmentBank, where it can be re-explored, queried and analyzed.
  Here we combined several of these cybertaxonomic tools to test the data extraction process for one potential application: the design and planning of an expedition to collect fresh material in the field. We targeted the ground spider Teutamus politus and other related species from the Teutamus group (TG) (Araneae; Liocranidae). These spiders are known from South East Asia and have been cataloged in the family Liocranidae; however, their relations, biology and evolution are still poorly understood. We marked-up 56 publications that contained taxonomic treatments with specimen records for the Liocranidae. Of these publications, 20 contained information on members of the TG. Geographical distributions and occurrences of 90 TG species were analyzed based on 1,309 specimen records. These data were used to design our field collection in a way that allowed us to optimize the collection of adult specimens of our target taxa.
  The TG genera were most common in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. From these, Thailand was the second richest but had the most records of T. politus. Seasonal distribution of TG specimens in Thailand suggested June and July as the best time for collecting adults. Based on these analyses, we decided to sample from mid-July to mid-August 2018 in the three Thai provinces that combined most records of TG species and T. politus.
  Relying on the results of our literature analyses and using standard collection methods for ground spiders, we captured at least one specimen of every TG genus reported for Thailand. Our one-month expedition captured 231 TG spiders; from these, T. politus was the most abundant species with 188 specimens (95 adults). By comparison, a total of 196 specimens of the TG and 66 of T. politus had been reported for the same provinces in the last 40 years. Our sampling greatly increased the number of available specimens, especially for the genera Teutamus and Oedignatha. Also, we extended the known distribution of Oedignatha and Sesieutes within Thailand.
  These results illustrate the relevance of making biodiversity data contained within taxonomic treatments accessible and reusable. It also exemplifies one potential use of taxonomic legacy data: to more efficiently use existing biodiversity data to fill knowledge gaps. A similar approach can be used to study neglected or interesting taxa and geographic areas, generating a better biodiversity documentation that could aid in decision making, management and conservation.},

This paper focuses on a particularly troublesome class of data, termed dark data. ``Dark data'' is not carefully indexed and stored so it becomes nearly invisible to scientists and other potential users and therefore is more likely to remain underutilized and eventually lost. The article discusses how the concepts from long-tail economics can be used to understand potential solutions for better curation of this data. The paper describes why this data is critical to scientific progress, some of the properties of this data, as well as some social and technical barriers to proper management of this class of data. Many potentially useful institutional, social, and technical solutions are under development and are introduced in the last sections of the paper, but these solutions are largely unproven and require additional research and development.},

@article{michener_nongeospatial_1997,
	abstract = {Issues related to data preservation and sharing are receiving increased attention from scientific societies, funding agencies, and the broad scientific community. Ecologists, for example, are increasingly using data collected by other scientists to address questions at broader spatial, temporal, and thematic scales (e.g., global change, biodiversity, sustainability). No data set is perfect and self-explanatory. Ecologists must, therefore, rely upon a set of instructions or documentation to acquire a specific data set, determine its suitability for meeting specific research objectives, and accurately interpret results from subsequent processing, analysis, and modeling. ``Metadata'' represent the set of instructions or documentation that describe the content, context, quality, structure, and accessibility of a data set. Although geospatial metadata standards have been developed and widely endorsed by the geographical science community, such standards do not yet exist for the ecological sciences. In this paper, we examine potential benefits and costs associated with developing and implementing metadata for nongeospatial ecological data. We present a set of generic metadata descriptors that could serve as the basis for a ``metadata standard'' for nongeospatial ecological data. Alternative strategies for metadata implementation that meet differing organizational or investigator-specific objectives are presented. Finally, we conclude with several recommendations related to future development and implementation of ecological metadata.},

Measuring the magnitude and rate of change more effectively requires access to organized, easily discoverable, and digitally-formatted biodiversity data, both legacy and new, from across the globe. Assembling this coherent digital representation of biodiversity requires the integration of data that have historically been analog, dispersed, and heterogeneous. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a software package developed to support biodiversity dataset publication in a common format. The IPT's two primary functions are to 1) encode existing species occurrence datasets and checklists, such as records from natural history collections or observations, in the Darwin Core standard to enhance interoperability of data, and 2) publish and archive data and metadata for broad use in a Darwin Core Archive, a set of files following a standard format. Here we discuss the key need for the IPT, how it has developed in response to community input, and how it continues to evolve to streamline and enhance the interoperability, discoverability, and mobilization of new data types beyond basic Darwin Core records. We close with a discussion how IPT has impacted the biodiversity research community, how it enhances data publishing in more traditional journal venues, along with new features implemented in the latest version of the IPT, and future plans for more enhancements.},

	abstract = {People are one of the best known and most stable entities in the biodiversity knowledge graph. The wealth of public information associated with people and the ability to identify them uniquely open up the possibility to make more use of these data in biodiversity science. Person data are almost always associated with entities such as specimens, molecular sequences, taxonomic names, observations, images, traits and publications. For example, the digitization and the aggregation of specimen data from museums and herbaria allow us to view a scientist's specimen collecting in conjunction with the whole corpus of their works. However, the metadata of these entities are also useful in validating data, integrating data across collections and institutional databases and can be the basis of future research into biodiversity and science. In addition, the ability to reliably credit collectors for their work has the potential to change the incentive structure to promote improved curation and maintenance of natural history collections.},

Meeting this ambitious goal requires increased collaboration and technological innovation and broader engagement beyond the walls of universities and museums. Engaging the public in digitization promises to both serve the digitizing institutions and further the public understanding of biodiversity science. We discuss three broad areas accessible to public participants that will accelerate research progress: label and ledger transcription, georeferencing from locality descriptions, and specimen annotation from images. We illustrate each activity, compare useful tools, present best practices and standards, and identify gaps in our knowledge and areas for improvement. The field of public participation in digitization of biodiversity research specimens is in a growth phase with many emerging opportunities for scientists, educators, and the public, as well as broader communication with complementary projects in other areas (e.g., the digital humanities).},

The key to predicting trait expression is having a large pool of data to derive models, but most organism trait observations are recorded in ways that are not computational. In this paper, intended for an interdisciplinary audience, we discuss data models for representing organism traits in a computable format. Increasing acceptance of a data model for traits will greatly increase the pool of available data for studying the dynamic processes that determine trait expression. We hope that explaining these data models in a straightforward way and articulating their potential for accelerating discovery will increase adoption of this promising data standard.},

Unfortunately, many of those analogue data are in precarious physical condition and only very few have been digitized. We review briefly the global situation regarding the status of those ``data at risk'', and suggest strategies that will ensure the preservation of the information that they contain, making it readily and easily accessible in the public domain for use in specific scientific research, disaster risk assessment, or citizen science projects.},

The data is accessible via TreatmentBank and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) and it is continually harvested and reused by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI). This data was processed, enhanced and liberated by the Plazi workflow, which involves a dedicated infrastructure including a desktop application (GoldenGate Imagine) that converts portable document format files (PDF) to a dedicated open compressed file format (Image Markup File (IMF)){\^A} that is responsible for the data enhancement. To enhance the data contained in the publications, including the biological interactions, a series of standards and vocabularies are used. To the exception of TaxPub, which is a taxonomic specific extension of the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS), all other used vocabulary were previously proposed. This goes along with Plazi{\^a}s mission to reuse standards unless they are not available. The following standards of vocabularies are used: Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS){\^A} to model article metadata information on Plazi{\^a}s XMLs; Darwin Core for taxonomic ranks and materials citation related data; Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO); Relations Ontology for biological interactions between organisms. The latter two are also used in the custom metadata in the Biodiversity Literature Repository at Zenodo.In this presentation we will provide an overview of the different types of data followed by the standards or vocabularies applied for every and each one of them and their parts. The goal is to provide the context on how the data liberated by Plazi is described, which is extensively reused by third-party applications such as GBIF or GloBI. The use of the standards allows fully automated, daily data ingests by GBIF.{\^A}},

@article{10.3897/rio.6.e58030,
	abstract = {We describe an effective approach to automated text digitisation with respect to natural history specimen labels. These labels contain much useful data about the specimen including its collector, country of origin, and collection date. Our approach to automatically extracting these data takes the form of a pipeline. Recommendations are made for the pipeline's component parts based on state-of-the-art technologies.Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used to digitise text on images of specimens. However, recognising text quickly and accurately from these images can be a challenge for OCR. We show that OCR performance can be improved by prior segmentation of specimen images into their component parts. This ensures that only text-bearing labels are submitted for OCR processing as opposed to whole specimen images, which inevitably contain non-textual information that may lead to false positive readings. In our testing Tesseract OCR version 4.0.0 offers promising text recognition accuracy with segmented images.Not all the text on specimen labels is printed. Handwritten text varies much more and does not conform to standard shapes and sizes of individual characters, which poses an additional challenge for OCR. Recently, deep learning has allowed for significant advances in this area. Google's Cloud Vision, which is based on deep learning, is trained on large-scale datasets, and is shown to be quite adept at this task. This may take us some way towards negating the need for humans to routinely transcribe handwritten text.Determining the countries and collectors of specimens has been the goal of previous automated text digitisation research activities. Our approach also focuses on these two pieces of information. An area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) known as Named Entity Recognition (NER) has matured enough to semi-automate this task. Our experiments demonstrated that existing approaches can accurately recognise location and person names within the text extracted from segmented images via Tesseract version 4.0.0.We have highlighted the main recommendations for potential pipeline components. The paper also provides guidance on selecting appropriate software solutions. These include automatic language identification, terminology extraction, and integrating all pipeline components into a scientific workflow to automate the overall digitisation process.},

	abstract = {A vast amount of biodiversity data is reported in the primary taxonomic literature. In the past, we have demonstrated the use of semantic enhancement to extract data from taxonomic literature and make it available to a network of databases (Miller et al. 2015). For technical reasons, semantic enhancement of taxonomic literature is most efficient when customized according to the format of a particular journal. This journal-based approach captures and disseminates data on whatever taxa happen to be published therein. But if we want to extract all treatments on a particular taxon of interest, these are likely to be spread across multiple journals. Fortunately, the GoldenGATE Imagine document editor (Sautter 2019) is flexible enough to parse most taxonomic literature. Tyrannosaurus rex is an iconic dinosaur with broad public appeal, as well as the subject of more than a century of scholarship. The Naturalis Biodiversity Center recently acquired a specimen that has become a major attraction in the public exhibit space. For most species on earth, the primary taxonomic literature contains nearly everything that is known about it. Every described species on earth is the subject of one or more taxonomic treatments. A taxon-based approach to semantic enhancement can mobilize all this knowledge using the network of databases and resources that comprise the modern biodiversity informatics infrastructure. When a particular species is of special interest, a taxon-based approach to semantic enhancement can be a powerful tool for scholarship and communication. In light of this, we resolved to semantically enhance all taxonomic treatments on T. rex. Our objective was to make these treatments and associated data available for the broad range of stakeholders who might have an interest in this animal, including professional paleontologists, the curious public, and museum exhibits and public communications personnel. Among the routine parsing and data sharing activities in the Plazi workflow (Agosti and Egloff 2009), taxonomic treatments, as well as cited figures, are deposited in the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR), and occurrence records are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Treatment citations were enhanced with hyperlinks to the cited treatment on TreatmentBank, and specimen citations were linked to their entries on public facing collections databases. We used the OpenBiodiv biodiversity knowledge graph{\^A} (Senderov et al. 2017) to discover other taxa mentioned together with T. rex,{\^A} and to create a timeline of T. rex research to evaluate the impact of individual researchers and specimen repositories to T. rex research.{\^A} We contributed treatment{\^A} links to WikiData, and queried{\^A} WikiData to discover identifiers to different platforms holding data about T. rex.{\^A} We used{\^A} bloodhound-tracker.net to disambiguate human agents, like collectors, identifiers, and authors.{\^A} We evaluate the adequacy of the fields currently available to extract data from taxonomic treatments, and make recommendations for future standards.},

Historical data provide a means of regaining that information, but they still are not commonly applied in marine conservation and management. Omission of relevant historical information typically results in assessments of conservation status that are more optimistic, recovery targets that are lower, and fisheries quotas that are higher than if long-term data were considered. Here, we review data and methods that can be used to estimate historical baselines for marine species including bony fishes, sharks, turtles, and mammals, demonstrate how baselines used in management change when historical data are included, and provide specific examples of how data from the past can be applied in management and conservation including extinction risk assessment, recovery target setting, and management of data-poor fisheries. Incorporating historical data into conservation and management frameworks presents challenges, but the alternative{\^a}losing information on past population sizes and ecological variability{\^a}represents a greater risk to effective management of marine species and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is a global consortium of over 460 contributors who have specifically chosen the BHL as the online platform to host their digitised biodiversity heritage literature. In 2018, staff from BHL Australia (a project funded by the Atlas of Living Australia and hosted by Museums Victoria) travelled across the Tasman Sea to work with the Auckland War Memorial Museum (T{\=a}maki Paenga Hira) to start a new branch of the BHL -- BHL New Zealand.
The Auckland War Memorial Museum has a novel approach when it comes to its own online content. They believe that the best way to amplify their collections is not via their own website, but via external collaborations. Acknowledging that their own website cannot best serve the many different types of content they curate and create, they seek the external platforms that can -- platforms that have the specific functionality required to make each type of content findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and that will reach and impact the greatest audience.
When the Auckland Museum was seeking the best platform for their biodiversity heritage literature, they were attracted by the BHL's functionality (such as Full Text Search, Optical Character Recognition and Global Names Recognition and Discovery); the extended discoverability and interoperability enabled via the BHL's partnerships (such as with the Encyclopedia of Life, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities); and BHL's massive audience.
However, the BHL is not the only platform hosting biodiversity heritage literature. Commercial publishers are rapidly uploading the back issues of the journals they host. There are now thousands of out-of-copyright journal articles on websites such as Wiley Online Library and Taylor \& Francis Online. Historic literature is not the primary focus for these publishers, but the functionality they provide for journal articles has brought the historic publications they host into the modern linked network of scholarly research. Every article on their websites, whether it was published 200 years ago or today, receives a Digital Object Identifier (a DOI).
A DOI is a unique permanent identifier assigned to a piece of online content (usually) at the time of its publication -- a persistent link that should be included in every citation of that piece of content. In an ideal world, the DOI system would enable readers to link from article to article in a never-ending trail of knowledge. However, a significant proportion of our historic literature still sits outside this linked network, representing dead ends (or at least annoying setbacks) in the quest for information. The other invaluable benefit of DOIs is that they provide citation metrics, allowing authors, publishers and institutions to track the use and impact of their publications.
The historic literature is the foundation upon which our understanding of biodiversity is based. It is critical that this foundation is easily discoverable, openly accessible, persistently linkable and unambiguously trackable. The BHL -- the world's largest online library of biodiversity heritage literature -- has an enormous role to play in ensuring that this literature is brought into the DOI system, and that publishers and researchers continue to have the option of an online platform that not only provides the best functionality for biodiversity heritage literature, but also open access to it.},

One of its services is to index taxonomic names in the collection to allow researchers to locate publications about specific taxa. The Global Names Architecture (GNA) is a system of web services to register, find, index, check and organize biological scientific names. GNA recently developed a new Name Finding algorithm and tool that has been integrated with BHL to improve taxonomic name searches within BHL. In our presentation, we will discuss a brief history of name finding in BHL, development of the Name Finding algorithm, results from implementing the algorithm, and challenges that still await us in the realm of taxonomic name finding in BHL.},

@article{rivera-quiroz_mining_2020,
	abstract = {Taxonomic literature contains information about virtually ever known species on Earth. In many cases, all that is known about a taxon is contained in this kind of literature, particularly for the most diverse and understudied groups. Taxonomic publications in the aggregate have documented a vast amount of specimen data. Among other things, these data constitute evidence of the existence of a particular taxon within a spatial and temporal context. When knowledge about a particular taxonomic group is rudimentary, investigators motivated to contribute new knowledge can use legacy records to guide them in their search for new specimens in the field. However, these legacy data are in the form of unstructured text, making it difficult to extract and analyze without a human interpreter. Here, we used a combination of semi-automatic tools to extract and categorize specimen data from taxonomic literature of one family of ground spiders (Liocranidae). We tested the application of these data on fieldwork optimization, using the relative abundance of adult specimens reported in literature as a proxy to find the best times and places for collecting the species (Teutamus politus) and its relatives (Teutamus group, TG) within Southeast Asia. Based on these analyses we decided to collect in three provinces in Thailand during the months of June and August. With our approach, we were able to collect more specimens of T. politus (188 specimens, 95 adults) than all the previous records in literature combined (102 specimens). Our approach was also effective for sampling other representatives of the TG, yielding at least one representative of every TG genus previously reported for Thailand. In total, our samples contributed 231 specimens (134 adults) to the 351 specimens previously reported in the literature for this country. Our results exemplify one application of mined literature data that allows investigators to more efficiently allocate effort and resources for the study of neglected, endangered, or interesting taxa and geographic areas. Furthermore, the integrative workflow demonstrated here shares specimen data with global online resources like Plazi and GBIF, meaning that others can freely reuse these data and contribute to them in the future. The contributions of the present study represent an increase of more than 35\% on the taxonomic coverage of the TG in GBIF based on the number of species. Also, our extracted data represents 72\% of the occurrences now available through GBIF for the TG and more than 85\% of occurrences of T. politus. Taxonomic literature is a key source of undigitized biodiversity data for taxonomic groups that are underrepresented in the current biodiversity data sphere. Mobilizing these data is key to understanding and protecting some of the less well-known domains of biodiversity.},

Our team of librarians, computer scientists and biologists produce high-quality text digitizations, develop new text-mining tools and generate detailed ontologies enabling semantic text analysis and semantic search by means of user-specific queries. In a pilot project we focus on German publications on the distribution and ecology of vascular plants, birds, moths and butterflies extending back to the Linnaeus period about 250 years ago. The three organism groups have been selected according to current demands of the relevant research community in Germany. The text corpus defined for this purpose comprises over 400 volumes with more than 100,000 pages to be digitized and will be complemented by journals from other digitization projects, copyright-free and project-related literature. With TextImager (Natural Language Processing \&amp; Text Visualization) and TextAnnotator (Discourse Semantic Annotation) we have already extended and launched tools that focus on the text-analytical section of our project. Furthermore, taxonomic and anatomical ontologies elaborated by us for the taxa prioritized by the project's target group - German institutions and scientists active in biodiversity research - are constantly improved and expanded to maximize scientific data output. Our poster describes the general workflow of our project ranging from literature acquisition via software development, to data availability on the BIOfid web portal (http://biofid.de/), and the implementation into existing platforms which serve to promote global accessibility of biodiversity data.},

@article{stuart-smith_thermal_2015,
	abstract = {A critical assumption underlying projections of biodiversity change associated with global warming is that ecological communities comprise balanced mixes of warm-affinity and cool-affinity species which, on average, approximate local environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, here we find that most shallow water marine species occupy broad thermal distributions that are aggregated in either temperate or tropical realms. These distributional trends result in ocean-scale spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming, and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as inferred from present-day species' distributional ranges, outweighs spatial variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species loss.},

	abstract = {The cTAKES package (using the ClearTK Natural Language Processing toolkit Bethard et al. 2014, http://cleartk.github.io/cleartk/) has been successfully used to automatically read clinical notes in the medical field (Albright et al. 2013, Styler et al. 2014). It is used on a daily basis to automatically process clinical notes and extract relevant information by dozens of medical institutions. ClearEarth is a collaborative project that brings together computational linguistics and domain scientists to port Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules trained on the same types of linguistic annotation to the fields of geology, cryology, and ecology. The goal for ClearEarth in the ecology domain is the extraction of ecologically-relevant terms, including eco-phenotypic traits from text and the assignment of those traits to taxa. Four annotators used Anafora (an annotation software; https://github.com/weitechen/anafora) to mark seven entity types (biotic, aggregate, abiotic, locality, quality, unit, value) and six reciprocal property types (synonym of/has synonym, part of/has part, subtype/supertype) in 133 documents from primarily Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Wikipedia according to project guidelines (https://github.com/ClearEarthProject/AnnotationGuidelines). Inter-annotator agreement ranged from 43\% to 90\%. Performance of ClearEarth on identifying named entities in biology text overall was good (precision: 85.56\%; recall: 71.57\%). The named entities with the best performance were organisms and their parts/products (biotic entities - precision: 72.09\%; recall: 54.17\%) and systems and environments (aggregate entities - precision: 79.23\%; recall: 75.34\%). Terms and their relationships extracted by ClearEarth can be embedded in the new ecocore ontology after vetting (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ecocore.html). This project enables use of advanced industry and research software within natural sciences for downstream operations such as data discovery, assessment, and analysis. In addition, ClearEarth uses the NLP results to generate domain-specific ontologies and other semantic resources.},

@article{driller_fast_2020,
	abstract = {The storage of data in public repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is nowadays stipulated in the policies of many publishers in order to facilitate data replication or proliferation. Species occurrence records contained in legacy printed literature are no exception to this. The extent of their digital and machine-readable availability, however, is still far from matching the existing data volume (Thessen and Parr 2014). But precisely these data are becoming more and more relevant to the investigation of ongoing loss of biodiversity. In order to extract species occurrence records at a larger scale from available publications, one has to apply specialised text mining tools. However, such tools are in short supply especially for scientific literature in the German language.
            
              The Specialised Information Service Biodiversity Research*1 BIOfid (Koch et al. 2017) aims at reducing this desideratum,
              inter alia
              , by preparing a searchable text corpus semantically enriched by a new kind of multi-label annotation. For this purpose, we feed manual annotations into automatic, machine-learning annotators. This mixture of automatic and manual methods is needed, because BIOfid approaches a new application area with respect to language (mainly German of the 19th century), text type (biological reports), and linguistic focus (technical and everyday language).
            
            
              We will present current results of the performance of BIOfid's semantic search engine and the application of independent natural language processing (NLP) tools. Most of these are freely available online, such as
              TextImager
              
              (Hemati et al. 2016). We will show how
              TextImager
              is tied into the BIOfid pipeline and how it is made scalable (e.g. extendible by further modules) and usable on different systems (docker containers).
            
            
              Further, we will provide a short introduction to generating machine-learning training data using
              TextAnnotator
              (Abrami et al. 2019) for multi-label annotation. Annotation reproducibility can be assessed by the implementation of inter-annotator agreement methods (Abrami et al. 2020). Beyond taxon recognition and entity linking, we place particular emphasis on location and time information. For this purpose, our annotation tag-set combines general categories and biology-specific categories (including taxonomic names) with location and time ontologies. The application of the annotation categories is regimented by annotation guidelines (L{\"u}cking et al. 2020). Within the next years, our work deliverable will be a semantically accessible and data-extractable text corpus of around two million pages. In this way, BIOfid is creating a new valuable resource that expands our knowledge of biodiversity and its determinants.},

Taxonomic data is becoming increasingly available on the web, but scientists need a way to access it in a programmatic fashion that's easy and reproducible. We have developed taxize, an open-source software package (freely available from
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxize/index.html) for the R language. taxize provides simple, programmatic access to taxonomic data for 13 data sources around the web. We discuss the need for a taxonomic toolbelt in R, and outline a suite of use cases for which taxize is ideally suited (including a full workflow as an appendix). The taxize package facilitates open and reproducible science by allowing taxonomic data collection to be done in the open-source R platform.},

@article{pafilis_extract_2017,
	abstract = {Data curation is a process occurring in many aspects of biodiversity research, e.g. in digitization of specimen collections and extraction of species occurrences from the legacy literature. Data curation is always characterized by being time demanding and tedious. Gathering information on species and exposing it via search interfaces could be facilitated once phrases of interest have been recognized and the mentioned entities have been linked to community resources.
  A curator can benefit from interactive systems that highlight biological entities in a document, indicating sections of interest, and map entities to corresponding database records/ontology terms, and offering an easy mechanism for extracting annotations in a structured form.
  EXTRACT (https://extract.hcmr.gr, Pafilis et al. 2016) is a system that aims to address the above challenges. Its web User Interface is a bookmarklet that identifies genes/proteins, chemical compounds, organisms, environments, tissues, diseases, phenotypes and Gene Ontology terms mentioned in a web page and maps them to their corresponding database, ontology, and taxonomy entries. Two modes of operation are supported: a. extraction of biological entities mentioned in user-selected piece of text, and b. full-page tagging. To easily collect extracted annotations, e.g. for use in an Excel spreadsheet, direct Copy to clipboard and Save to file (tab-delimited) are supported.
  EXTRACT was originally developed specifically to facilitate metagenomic sample record annotation (Pafilis et al. 2016). As such it participated in the BioCreative V interactive annotation task. EXTRACT achieved one of the top scores in terms of usability and was evaluated to accelerate curation by 15--25\% (Wang et al. 2016).
  The latest version of EXTRACT (2.0, Pafilis et al. 2017) serves a much broader audience involving both biomedicine and biodiversity researchers and thus recognizes a wide range of entity types from many community resources:
  
    Organisms (NCBI Taxonomy,  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) 
    Environments (Environment Ontology, Buttigieg et al. 2016)
    Diseases and phenotypes (Disease Ontology, Kibbe et al. 2014, and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Smith and Eppig 2012)
    Tissues and cell lines (Brenda Tissue Ontology, Placzek et al. 2016)
    Biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components (Gene Ontology,  Gene Ontology Consortium 2014)
    Protein-coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes from more than 2000 organisms (STRING (Szklarczyk et al. 2017) and  RAIN  (Junge et al. 2017))
    Small molecule compounds (STITCH (Szklarczyk et al. 2015))
  
  In addition to curators benefitting from such a tool, knowledge-base developers can easily integrate the EXTRACT functionality into their own systems. To this end, we provide a robust and thoroughly documented Application Programming Interface (https://extract.hcmr.gr, FAQ section). EXTRACT can thus serve as a building block in large knowledge management pipelines, which also perform downstream tasks such as statistical entity association and association extraction, knowledge graph generation presenting the extracted associations, document indexing and information retrieval.
  Such tasks lie at the core of the workshop this abstract has been submitted to and are pertinent to the TDWG 2017 theme, which is dedicated to the integration of species occurrence, gene, phenotype, and environment associations.},

@article{fortibuoni_coding_2010,
	abstract = {The understanding of fish communities' changes over the past centuries has important implications for conservation policy and marine resource management. However, reconstructing these changes is difficult because information on marine communities before the second half of the 20th century is, in most cases, anecdotal and merely qualitative. Therefore, historical qualitative records and modern quantitative data are not directly comparable, and their integration for long-term analyses is not straightforward. We developed a methodology that allows the coding of qualitative information provided by early naturalists into semi-quantitative information through an intercalibration with landing proportions. This approach allowed us to reconstruct and quantitatively analyze a 200-year-long time series of fish community structure indicators in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Our analysis provides evidence of long-term changes in fish community structure, including the decline of Chondrichthyes, large-sized and late-maturing species. This work highlights the importance of broadening the time-frame through which we look at marine ecosystem changes and provides a methodology to exploit, in a quantitative framework, historical qualitative sources. To the purpose, naturalists' eyewitness accounts proved to be useful for extending the analysis on fish community back in the past, well before the onset of field-based monitoring programs.},
