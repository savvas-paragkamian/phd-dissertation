abstract = {The quest for a global soil classification system has been a long-standing challenge in soil science. There currently exist two, seemingly disjoint, global soil classification systems, the USDA Soil Taxonomy and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, and many regional and national systems. While both systems are acknowledged as international, there remain various examples of their shortcoming in accounting of topsoil features, local applications and communication with established regional classification systems. This calls for a numerical soil classification that addresses these discrepancies and achieves harmonization with existing national systems. In this paper, we report on the development of a natural layer classification system — as opposed to the classification of soil profile entities, as a first step towards achieving a comprehensive global numerical soil classification not based on a priori defined classes. We implemented a modelling approach with a set of predicted key soil properties available globally for the soil surface layer with the same depth range of 0–5 cm. The set of properties was partitioned into a number of homogeneous and disjoint classes using the k-means clustering algorithm. Next, we investigated the pattern of variation of the clusters in association with the soil property map with principal component analysis. A three-component nomenclature system is derived in a transformed space of the class-specific centroids to account for the uneven distribution of the centroids in the principal component space. We show that it is possible to build a data-based objective numerical taxonomic classification of soil layers, and that existing sets of key soil properties, predicted separately, coalesce into identifiable clusters or classes and manifest discernible spatial and/or pedological patterns. This grouping of key soil properties to logical categories is a possible step to better define diagnostic horizon features and suggest new ones. The general-purpose map of soil surface layer classes of the world also has potential applications in assessing soil change and designing monitoring surveys.}

abstract = {Abstract Soil microbial diversity mediates a wide range of key processes and ecosystem services influencing planetary health. Our knowledge of microbial biogeography patterns, spatial drivers and human impacts at the continental scale remains limited. Here, we reveal the drivers of bacterial and fungal community distribution in Australian topsoils using 1384 soil samples from diverse bioregions. Our findings highlight that climate factors, particularly precipitation and temperature, along with soil properties, are the primary drivers of topsoil microbial biogeography. Using random forest machine-learning models, we generated high-resolution maps of soil bacteria and fungi across continental Australia. The maps revealed microbial hotspots, for example, the eastern coast, southeastern coast, and west coast were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Fungal distribution is strongly influenced by precipitation, with Ascomycota dominating the central region. This study also demonstrated the impact of human modification on the underground microbial community at the continental scale, which significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, but decreased Chloroflexi and Basidiomycota. The variations in microbial phyla could be attributed to distinct responses to altered environmental factors after human modifications. This study provides insights into the biogeography of soil microbiota, valuable for regional soil biodiversity assessments and monitoring microbial responses to global changes.},

abstract = {The applicability of detailed soil surveys limited to small reference areas to larger regions should be assessed using easily available data. This is done in this paper by computing at each site of the large region a mathematical distance between local soilscapes and those in the reference area. Soilscapes are represented by a cover frequency vector of elementary landscape classes (combinations of soil-forming factor classes) calculated within an area defined around the site under consideration. The application of this technique to four reference areas located in the Hérault–Libron–Orb valleys in the south of France demonstrated that: (1) the proposed soilscape distance was in good agreement with the degree of representativity of a reference area (i.e. percentage of soil classes already encountered in the reference area), (2) representative areas of different size and purity can be delineated from a soilscape distance map by applying a distance threshold, (3) expertise in delineating a reference area has a strong influence on its performances, i.e. size vs. purity of representative area. This suggests that the soilscape distance tested in this paper could be integrated in a classification procedure defining the optimal size and location of future reference areas.}

TITLE = {Assessment of Water-Induced Soil Erosion as a Threat to Natura 2000 Protected Areas in Crete Island, Greece},

ABSTRACT = {Water erosion is a major threat to biodiversity, according to the European Commission’s Soil Thematic Strategy, as it negatively affects soil structure, soil fertility and water availability for plants. The island of Crete (Southern Greece) has been characterized as a biodiversity hotspot including several Natura 2000 (N2K)-protected areas. The aim of this study was to model the soil loss rate in Crete regarding species richness, habitat types and their conservation status, as well as the MAES (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem and their Services) ecosystem types. To this end, the RUSLE soil erosion prediction model was implemented, using freely available geospatial data and cloud-computing processes. The estimated average soil loss in the study area was 6.15 t ha−1 y−1, while there was no significant difference between the terrestrial N2K (6.06 t ha−1 y−1) and non-N2K (6.19 t ha−1 y−1) areas. Notably, the natural habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity (referred to as “priority” areas), according to Annex I to Directive 92/43/EEC, are threatened by soil erosion with an estimated mean annual soil loss equal to 8.58 t ha−1 y−1. It is also notable that grasslands, heathland and shrubs and sparsely vegetated areas experienced the highest erosion rates among the identified MAES ecosystem types. The results showed that soil erosion is a serious threat to biodiversity in N2K-protected areas. Therefore, there is a need for systematic spatiotemporal monitoring and the implementation of erosion mitigation measures.},

    abstract = {Metagenomics projects based on shotgun sequencing of populations of micro-organisms yield insight into protein families. We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms. About 6,000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall, besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins, the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These observations are illustrated using several protein families, including phosphatases, proteases, ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes, glutamine synthetase, and RuBisCO. The diversity added by GOS data has implications for choosing targets for experimental structure characterization as part of structural genomics efforts. Our analysis indicates that new families are being discovered at a rate that is linear or almost linear with the addition of new sequences, implying that we are still far from discovering all protein families in nature.},

ABSTRACT = {Islands across the world have evolved at the interface between land and sea, thus comprising landscapes and seascapes. Many islands have also been influenced by anthropogenic factors, which have given rise to mosaics of anthromes (sensu Ellis and Ramankutty). These elements of landscapes, seascapes, and cultural impacts in varied proportions, generate unique environments which merit a unique term: islandscapes. The use of the term islandscape is advocated as the only term which encompasses all of the constituent components of an island, in a holistic manner. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the applicability of existing landscape and seascape character assessment methodologies in an island context, and to propose a methodological framework for mapping the space which defines the term ‘islandscape’. The challenges and opportunities stemming from the use of the term are exemplified with reference to the Mediterranean islands.},

JOURNAL = {Biodiversity and Conservation},
YEAR = {2024},
ABSTRACT = {Arthropods' decline has been documented in global and local studies, yet they are still not sufficiently protected on a global scale. Crete (Greece), a Mediterranean hotspot is a continental island, renowned for its diverse geology, ecosystems and endemicity of flora and fauna, with many studies on all of the above disciplines dating back to the 19th century. Here we investigate the conservation status of the Cretan Arthropods using Preliminary Automated Conservation Assessments (PACA) and the overlap of Cretan Arthropod distributions with the Natura 2000 protected areas. In order to perform this analysis, we assembled occurrences of the endemic Arthropods in Crete located in the collections of the Natural History Museum of Crete together with literature data. These assessments resulted in 75\% of endemic Arthropods as potentially threatened. The hotspots of endemic and threatened taxa are distributed mostly on the mountainous areas where the Natura 2000 protected areas have great coverage. Yet human activities have significant impact even in those areas, while some taxa are not sufficiently covered by Natura 2000. These findings call for countermeasures and conservation actions.},

ABSTRACT={Historical biodiversity documents comprise an important link to the long-term data life cycle and provide useful insights on several aspects of biodiversity research and management. However, because of their historical context, they present specific challenges, primarily time- and effort-consuming in data curation. The data rescue process requires a multidisciplinary effort involving four tasks: (a) Document digitisation (b) Transcription, which involves text recognition and correction, and (c) Information Extraction, which is performed using text mining tools and involves the entity identification, their normalisation and their co-mentions in text. Finally, the extracted data go through (d) Publication to a data repository in a standardised format. Each of these tasks requires a dedicated multistep methodology with standards and procedures. During the past 8 years, Information Extraction (IE) tools have undergone remarkable advances, which created a landscape of various tools with distinct capabilities specific to biodiversity data. These tools recognise entities in text such as taxon names, localities, phenotypic traits and thus automate, accelerate and facilitate the curation process. Furthermore, they assist the normalisation and mapping of entities to specific identifiers. This work focuses on the IE step (c) from the marine historical biodiversity data perspective. It orchestrates IE tools and provides the curators with a unified view of the methodology; as a result the documentation of the strengths, limitations and dependencies of several tools was drafted. Additionally, the classification of tools into Graphical User Interface (web and standalone) applications and Command Line Interface ones enables the data curators to select the most suitable tool for their needs, according to their specific features. In addition, the high volume of already digitised marine documents that await curation is amassed and a demonstration of the methodology, with a new scalable, extendable and containerised tool, “DECO” (bioDivErsity data Curation programming wOrkflow) is presented. DECO’s usage will provide a solid basis for future curation initiatives and an augmented degree of reliability towards high value data products that allow for the connection between the past and the present, in marine biodiversity research.}

ABSTRACT = {To elucidate ecosystem functioning, it is fundamental to recognize what processes occur in which environments (where) and which microorganisms carry them out (who). Here, we present PREGO, a one-stop-shop knowledge base providing such associations. PREGO combines text mining and data integration techniques to mine such what-where-who associations from data and metadata scattered in the scientific literature and in public omics repositories. Microorganisms, biological processes, and environment types are identified and mapped to ontology terms from established community resources. Analyses of comentions in text and co-occurrences in metagenomics data/metadata are performed to extract associations and a level of confidence is assigned to each of them thanks to a scoring scheme. The PREGO knowledge base contains associations for 364,508 microbial taxa, 1090 environmental types, 15,091 biological processes, and 7971 molecular functions with a total of almost 58 million associations. These associations are available through a web portal, an Application Programming Interface (API), and bulk download. By exploring environments and/or processes associated with each other or with microbes, PREGO aims to assist researchers in design and interpretation of experiments and their results. To demonstrate PREGOs capabilities, a thorough presentation of its web interface is given along with a meta-analysis of experimental results from a lagoon-sediment study of sulfur-cycle related microbes.},

Therefore, extracting and analyzing biomedical terms from such files in an automated way is absolutely necessary. In this article, we present OnTheFly2.0, a web application for extracting biomedical entities from individual files such as plain texts, office documents, PDF files or images. OnTheFly2.0 can generate informative summaries in popup windows containing knowledge related to the identified terms along with links to various databases. It uses the EXTRACT tagging service to perform named entity recognition (NER) for genes/proteins, chemical compounds, organisms, tissues, environments, diseases, phenotypes and gene ontology terms. Multiple files can be analyzed, whereas identified terms such as proteins or genes can be explored through functional enrichment analysis or be associated with diseases and PubMed entries. Finally, protein–protein and protein–chemical networks can be generated with the use of STRING and STITCH services. To demonstrate its capacity for knowledge discovery, we interrogated published meta-analyses of clinical biomarkers of severe COVID-19 and uncovered inflammatory and senescence pathways that impact disease pathogenesis. OnTheFly2.0 currently supports 197 species and is available at http://bib.fleming.gr:3838/OnTheFly/ and http://onthefly.pavlopouloslab.info.}",

While research and assessment on beach litter is increasing and involves various actors (scientists, society and NGOs), there is the need to assess current and future dominant trends, directions and priorities in that research. As such, a textural co-occurrence analysis was applied to published scientific literature. Words were considered both singly and as part of compound terms related to concepts relevant to sandy beach ecology: morphodynamic state; Littoral Active Zone; indicator fauna. Litter as a compound term was also included. The main co-occurrences were found within compounds, with scarce interaction of ``morphodynamic state''with the others, indicating the need for further integration of beach ecology paradigms into beached plastics studies. Three approaches are proposed to overcome the research limits highlighted: the unequivocation of terms, the consideration of adequate scales, and the attention to dynamics rather than just patterns.},

abstract = {A new soil erosion model, namely G2, was applied in the island of Crete with a focus on agricultural land uses, including potential grazing lands. The G2 model was developed within the Geoland2 project as an agro-environmental service in the framework of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES, now Copernicus) initiative. The G2 model takes advantage of the empirical background of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and the Gavrilovic model, together with readily available time series of vegetation layers and 10-min rainfall intensity data to produce monthly time-step erosion risk maps at 300m cell size. The innovations of the G2 model include the implementation of land-use influence parameters based on empirical data and the introduction of a corrective term in the estimation of the topographic influence factor. The mean annual erosion rate in Crete was found to be 8.123tha−1. The season from October to January (the rainy season in Crete) was found to be the most critical, accounting for 80\% of the annual erosion in the island. Seasonal erosion figures proved to be crucial for the identification of erosion hotspots and of risky land uses. In Crete, high annual erosion figures were detected in natural grasslands and shrublands (14.023tha−1), mainly due to the intensification of livestock grazing during the past decades. The G2 model allows for the integrated spatio-temporal monitoring of soil erosion per land-use type based on moderate data input requirements and existing datasets.}

abstract = {Increasing the speed of scientific progress is urgently needed to address the many challenges associated with the biosphere in the Anthropocene. Consequently, the critical question becomes: How can science most rapidly progress to address large, complex global problems? We suggest that the lag in the development of a more predictive science of the biosphere is not only because the biosphere is so much more complex, or because we do not have enough data, or are not doing enough experiments, but, in large part, because of unresolved tension between the three dominant scientific cultures that pervade the research community. We introduce and explain the concept of the three scientific cultures and present a novel analysis of their characteristics, supported by examples and a formal mathematical definition/representation of what this means and implies. The three cultures operate, to varying degrees, across all of science. However, within the biosciences, and in contrast to some of the other sciences, they remain relatively more separated, and their lack of integration has hindered their potential power and insight. Our solution to accelerating a broader, predictive science of the biosphere is to enhance integration of scientific cultures. The process of integration—Scientific Transculturalism—recognizes that the push for interdisciplinary research, in general, is just not enough. Unless these cultures of science are formally appreciated and their thinking iteratively integrated into scientific discovery and advancement, there will continue to be numerous significant challenges that will increasingly limit forecasting and prediction efforts.}}

The necessity to realize SDGs by 2030 also inspires a greater sense of responsibility and care for soils. Sustainable management of soil health is important to achieving several SDGs. Pertinent SDGs intricately connected with soil health include SDG 1 (End Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 5 (Gender Equality), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land). Some of these SDGs rely considerably on plant production and others depend on soil processes. Pertinent among soil processes are water movement, heat transfer, sorption and physical filtration, ion exchange, and biochemical and biophysical transformations. In terms of specific accomplishments, 130 countries have aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge, the globally available fresh water has decreased to 71\% of needs, Technosols (soils whose formation is influenced by anthropogenic based materials) are used in urban ecosystems, food wastes are composted, specific targets of Land Degradation Neutrality have been signed by several countries, and soil C sequestration targets are widely implemented through initiatives such as the 4 Per Thousand (4P1000) initiative, Platform on Climate Action in Americas (PLACA), Adapting African Agriculture (AAA), Living Soils of the Americas (LiSAM), etc. In addition, policy and regulatory frameworks being widely promoted by several U.N. agencies (e.g., U.N. SDGs,limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2 C) can be supported by innovations in soil science including forensic soil science, remote sensing and other innovations. Soil health is becoming a central element of the research and innovation program of the EU, aiming to reach a 75\% of healthy soils by 2030. In addition, the importance of soil health to human health and environmental issues is being widely promoted through educational books on soil science and secondary schools, as well as the revision of curricula. With continuous progress in movement into the digital world, transfer and communication of knowledge of the soil sciences can improve for the end users, policymakers, and the general public but additional efforts are needed. Soil science knowledge and research forms a significant contribution to specific aspects of food and nutritional security, human wellbeing, nature conservancy, and global peace and harmony. Achieving critical SDGs by 2030 can be facilitated by soil restoration and sustainable management.}

abstract = {Abstract Soil functions, including climate regulation and the cycling of water and nutrients, are of central importance for a number of environmental issues of great societal concern. To understand and manage these functions, it is crucial to be able to quantify the structure of soils, now increasingly referred to as their “architecture,” as it constraints the physical, chemical and biological processes in soils. This quantification was traditionally approached from two different angles, one focused on aggregates of the solid phase, and the other on the pore space. The recent development of sophisticated, non-disturbing imaging techniques has led to significant progress in the description of soil architecture, in terms of both the pore space and the spatial configuration of mineral and organic materials. We now have direct access to virtually all aspects of soil architecture. In the present article, we review how this affects the perception of soil architecture specifically when trying to describe the functions of soils. A key conclusion of our analysis is that soil architecture, in that context, imperatively needs to be explored in its natural state, with as little disturbance as possible. The same requirement applies to the key processes taking place in the hierarchical soil pore network, including those contributing to the emergence of a heterogeneous organo-mineral soil matrix by various mixing processes, such as bioturbation, diffusion, microbial metabolism and organo-mineral interactions. Artificially isolated aggregates are fundamentally inappropriate for deriving conclusions about the functioning of an intact soil. To fully account for soil functions, we argue that a holistic approach that centres on the pore space is mandatory while the dismantlement of soils into chunks may still be carried out to study the binding of soil solid components. In the future, significant progress is expected along this holistic direction, as new, advanced technologies become available. Highlights We highlight the crucial importance of the temporal dynamics of soil architecture for biological activity and carbon turnover. We reconcile controversial concepts relative to how soil architecture is formed and reshaped with time. Soil is demonstrated to be a heterogeneous porous matrix and not an assembly of aggregates. Biological and physical mixing processes are key for the formation and dynamics of soil architecture.},

abstract = {Network analysis has been used for many years in ecological research to analyze organismal associations, for example in food webs, plant-plant or plant-animal interactions. Although network analysis is widely applied in microbial ecology, only recently has it entered the realms of soil microbial ecology, shown by a rapid rise in studies applying co-occurrence analysis to soil microbial communities. While this application offers great potential for deeper insights into the ecological structure of soil microbial ecosystems, it also brings new challenges related to the specific characteristics of soil datasets and the type of ecological questions that can be addressed. In this Perspectives Paper we assess the challenges of applying network analysis to soil microbial ecology due to the small-scale heterogeneity of the soil environment and the nature of soil microbial datasets. We review the different approaches of network construction that are commonly applied to soil microbial datasets and discuss their features and limitations. Using a test dataset of microbial communities from two depths of a forest soil, we demonstrate how different experimental designs and network constructing algorithms affect the structure of the resulting networks, and how this in turn may influence ecological conclusions. We will also reveal how assumptions of the construction method, methods of preparing the dataset, and definitions of thresholds affect the network structure. Finally, we discuss the particular questions in soil microbial ecology that can be approached by analyzing and interpreting specific network properties. Targeting these network properties in a meaningful way will allow applying this technique not in merely descriptive, but in hypothesis-driven research. Analysing microbial networks in soils opens a window to a better understanding of the complexity of microbial communities. However, this approach is unfortunately often used to draw conclusions which are far beyond the scientific evidence it can provide, which has damaged its reputation for soil microbial analysis. In this Perspectives Paper, we would like to sharpen the view for the real potential of microbial co-occurrence analysis in soils, and at the same time raise awareness regarding its limitations and the many ways how it can be misused or misinterpreted.}

We further revealed that soil networks with greater levels of positive associations supported larger soil biodiversity and resulted in lower network fragility to withstand potential perturbations of species losses. Our study provides unique evidence of the widespread positive associations between soil organisms and their crucial role in maintaining the multitrophic structure of soil biodiversity worldwide.}}

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable progress in determining the soil properties that influence the structure of the soil microbiome. By contrast, the effects of microorganisms on their soil habitat have received less attention with most previous studies focusing on microbial contributions to soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. However, soil microorganisms are not only involved in nutrient cycling and organic matter transformations but also alter the soil habitat through various biochemical and biophysical mechanisms. Such microbially mediated modifications of soil properties can have local impacts on microbiome assembly with pronounced ecological ramifications. In this Review, we describe the processes by which microorganisms modify the soil environment, considering soil physics, hydrology and chemistry. We explore how microorganism--soil interactions can generate feedback loops and discuss how microbially mediated modifications of soil properties can serve as an alternative avenue for the management and manipulation of microbiomes to combat soil threats and global change.},

Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale.

abstract = {The GEMAS (geochemical mapping of agricultural soil) project collected 2108 Ap horizon soil samples from regularly ploughed fields in 33 European countries, covering 5.6 million km2. The <2 mm fraction of these samples was analysed for 53 elements by ICP-MS and ICP-AES, following a HNO3/HCl/H2O (modified aqua regia) digestion. Results are used here to establish the geochemical background variation and threshold values, derived statistically from the data set, in order to identify unusually high element concentrations for these elements in the Ap samples. Potentially toxic elements (PTEs), namely Ag, B, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, U, V and Zn, and emerging ‘high-tech’ critical elements (HTCEs), i.e., lanthanides (e.g., Ce, La), Be, Ga, Ge, In, Li and Tl, are of particular interest. For the latter, neither geochemical background nor threshold at the European scale has been established before. Large differences in the spatial distribution of many elements are observed between northern and southern Europe. It was thus necessary to establish three different sets of geochemical threshold values, one for the whole of Europe, a second for northern and a third for southern Europe. These values were then compared to existing soil guideline values for (eco)toxicological effects of these elements, as defined by various European authorities. The regional sample distribution with concentrations above the threshold values is studied, based on the GEMAS data set, following different methods of determination. Occasionally local contamination sources (e.g., cities, metal smelters, power plants, agriculture) can be identified. No indications could be detected at the continental scale for a significant impact of diffuse contamination on the regional distribution of element concentrations in the European agricultural soil samples. At this European scale, the variation in the natural background concentration of all investigated elements in the agricultural soil samples is much larger than any anthropogenic impact.}

The use of widely applicable methodologies can facilitate the identification of land desertification risk spatio-temporal trends, which allows transnational comparison and support the development of soil management practices and policies, protecting the valuable soil resources. The aim of this study is to improve and use the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) MEDALUS methodology, in order to provide a qualitative assessment for desertification risk trends in Greece, within the last 45 years. The Management, Vegetation, Soil and Climate quality indices (MQI, VQI, SQI, CQI) and the sub-sequent Environmental Sensitive Areas Index (ESAI) have been modeled for three periods in the entire Greek territory. The four quality indices are divided in two main categories, based on data availability and inherent characteristics, such as the pace of change during the studied period. Particular emphasis is given to the assessment of MQI, by integrating criteria which derived from national policies and the elaboration of national statistical data. The results show about 9\% increase of the areas characterized as Critical to land desertification risk, while Fragile, Potentially affected and Non-affected areas decrease by 3.7\%, 3.6\%, 2.5\% respectively. The applied approach for MQI can reveal areas where particular attention to management practices is required and improves the performance of the overall desertification risk index.}

However, along a number of fronts, knowledge has advanced dramatically, particularly regarding the dynamic ‘solid’ Earth (plate tectonics, ocean-floor thermal-cooling subsidence, mantle-plume hotspots, etc.), as well as the behaviour of the planet's liquid and gaseous envelopes, today and in the geological past. This manuscript serves as an introduction to a series of articles aimed at providing the biological/biogeographical community with an overview of the current understanding of the physical settings of the marine islands, that is, the substrates upon which the biotas accumulate and develop. Location Global. Results I propose separate classification systems for the biotic assemblage components and the physical island types to replace the current mixed scheme of recent continental, ancient continental and oceanic. The lifeforms can be assigned to one of four classes reflecting how an organism's founder ancestors colonized an island: recent land bridge, recent ice-sheet, overwater dispersed and deep-time vicariant (an island may host two or more of these types). The nomenclature for the islands reflects their geo-physical setting and has the advantage of indicating the ontogenetic path the landmass is on. In turn, this may feed back into the way the hosted biology is viewed. Four major categories are recognized: continental, island arc, composite terrane and mantle-plume hotspot, plus a handful of left-overs. These groups can be further split into between three and nine types. Main conclusion Separating the classifications of the island biotic assemblage components and the physical island varieties (of which there are many sorts) makes it possible to assign all islands and their biotas unambiguously. It thus provides an appreciably more nuanced scheme than Wallace's threefold system.},

We illustrate the impact of compositionality on the interpretation of relative abundance data and discuss effects of sample replication on the statistical power in soil community analysis.

Increasing reliance on ground water presents a risk for the future. The main changes in the landscape are a great extension of the area under olives, and an increase in natural trees and bushes. More pines present a fire hazard. Burning of maquis by shepherds requires further examination. Migration, urbanisation and technological developments in agriculture in the last few decades have had a profound effect on Mediterranean landscapes. Depopulation of mountainous inland areas and small offshore islands results in a diminution of the historical and scenic value of their landscapes. This research project aims to identify and characterise landscapes in western Crete which are of special value and which are threatened by current developments; it attempts to trace changes in the last few decades, and to propose means of maintaining them in the future.}

The key biogeographical variables identified by their theory were island size and distance from the mainland. They suggested that an island's biodiversity is proportionate to the island's size (i.e. the larger the island the higher the species number) and inversely proportionate to its distance from the mainland (i.e. more remote islands tend to support less species). Equally significantly they argued that the number of species on an island is in a state of dynamic equilibrium -- diversity eventually stabilises but turnover remains high as species continually colonise and go extinct. Dynamism is a defining concept when attempting to understand the biogeography of islands and, in the Mediterranean in particular, the impact of human activity over millennia has resulted in very high levels of dynamism with profound consequences for the biota.",

abstract={The Aegean archipelago, comprising numerous islands and islets with great heterogeneity in topographic, geological, historical and environmental properties, offers an ideal natural laboratory for ecological and evolutionary research, and has been the stage for a very long interaction between human civilizations and local ecosystems. This work presents insights that have been gained from past and current relevant research in the area, highlighting also the importance of the Aegean archipelago as a useful model to address many major questions in biogeography, ecology and evolutionary processes. Among the most interesting findings from such studies concern the role of habitat heterogeneity as the most important determinant of species richness, the development of a new model (Choros) for the species--area--habitats relationship, the mechanistic aspects of the Small Island Effect, the very high rates of species turnover, the lack of a role for interspecific competition in shaping species co-occurrence patterns in most cases, the importance of non adaptive radiation in diversification of several taxa, the insights into the relative roles of vicariance and dispersal in speciation, the understanding of the interplay between human presence and the establishment of exotic species and extinction of indigenous biotas. Concluding, the Aegean archipelago is an ideal stage for research in evolution, ecology and biogeography, and has the potential to become a model study area at a global level, especially for land-bridge, continental islands.},

abstract={Mediterranean islands (MI) are hotspots of global biodiversity and lie in one of the most susceptible to climate change (CC) areas of the world; a big challenge for any conservation strategy. In fact, there is already increasing evidence for CC in the region and associated biological responses in MI ecosystems. These include phenological changes and upward elevation shifts of species and plant communities; although evidence is frequently contrasting for different taxa. Threats are also evident, mainly for endemic species from most taxonomic groups, while communities in mountain and coastal regions are likely to be affected most. For MI conservation under CC additional factors need to be considered: (i) their position at the crossroads of three continents; with which they share common environmental characteristics, (ii) their great variability in sizes and topography and (iii) their climatic differences; with a clear west-east basin divide. CC synergies with changing tourist aspiration and agricultural practices will, in the medium term, modify island landscapes and provide further challenges for biodiversity conservation. Such a combined impact from CC, land-use change, fragmentation of habitats and tourism is difficult to predict. Furthermore, the limited space on islands (especially habitat availability and climatic range limitations) imposes a barrier to species range expansion. Thus, conservation of MI biodiversity under CC requires: (i) future research to focus on improved climate predictions linked to improved understanding of ecological (climate-biotic) responses, incorporating lessons learnt from (island) biogeography, (ii) specific adaptation measures for spatial planning and improvement in regional institutional capacities.},

It has 15 mountain ranges, three of them more than 2,000 m high. Like other islands in this book, Crete once had a great independent civilisation, the Minoan in the Bronze Age (2900--1150 BC); although related to neighbouring islands it is distinct from mainland Greece, Anatolia, or Egypt. From the late Bronze Age onwards Crete became subsumed into the Greek world, though it retained some distinctiveness: it had its own gods who were different from those on Mount Olympus in mainland Greece. The next most conspicuous period in Cretan archaeology is the early Byzantine (AD 300--600), in which it differed less from other provinces of the Empire. In the Middle Ages, Crete was an imperial province of Venice (AD 1200--1650), and developed a hybrid of Byzantine and Venetian culture, different from other Venetian islands, though related to that of Kythera. In Ancient Greek times (700--100 BC) Crete was a collection of independent `city-states'; since then it has been part of the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, again Byzantine, Venetian, and Turkish empires, and since 1913 part of the Greek state. Crete has often not been self-sufficient but at times it has exported olive oil, cereals, wine and cheese. For centuries it had a mixed economy. Most individual households grew cereals, legumes, vines and olives, kept sheep and goats (mainly for cheese) and often a donkey, cow and pig. Wine and oil were cash crops. Over the last three centuries oil production has gradually increased and now dominates the agricultural economy.",

Until recently, similar studies were impossible for microorganisms, arguably the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. Here, we present a continental-scale description of soil bacterial communities and the environmental factors influencing their biodiversity. We collected 98 soil samples from across North and South America and used a ribosomal DNA-fingerprinting method to compare bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. Bacterial diversity was unrelated to site temperature, latitude, and other variables that typically predict plant and animal diversity, and community composition was largely independent of geographic distance. The diversity and richness of soil bacterial communities differed by ecosystem type, and these differences could largely be explained by soil pH (r2 = 0.70 and r2 = 0.58, respectively; P \&lt; 0.0001 in both cases). Bacterial diversity was highest in neutral soils and lower in acidic soils, with soils from the Peruvian Amazon the most acidic and least diverse in our study. Our results suggest that microbial biogeography is controlled primarily by edaphic variables and differs fundamentally from the biogeography of macro organisms.}}

Location We focus on the large spatial scale of mainland France using the largest spatially explicit soil sampling set available across France (2,173 soils, area=5.5x105 km2). Major taxa studied Soil bacteria and archaea were studied by a high throughput sequencing approach targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene directly amplified from soil DNA. Methods We applied decision tree learning and geostatistical approaches combining the abundant data on soil microbes and large-scale environmental description in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis of soil bacterial and archaeal communities. Results We identified a complex mosaic of 16 distinct terrestrial habitats, based on soil type and management (pH, C:N ratio, land use). As for plants and animals, each habitat hosted generalist and specialist taxa and a specific interaction network directly or indirectly impacted by human activities. Main conclusions In a context of global change, our results emphasize that the policies for biodiversity and habitat conservation should now integrate soil microorganisms conceptually and technically.},

These data gaps include important spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.3{\%} of all sampling sites having both information about biodiversity and function, although with different taxonomic groups and functions at each site.

We found the lowest bacterial and fungal diversity in less-disturbed environments (woodlands) compared to grasslands and highly-disturbed environments (croplands). Highly-disturbed environments contain significantly more bacterial chemoheterotrophs, harbour a higher proportion of fungal plant pathogens and saprotrophs, and have less beneficial fungal plant symbionts compared to woodlands and extensively-managed grasslands. Spatial patterns of microbial communities and predicted functions are best explained when interactions among the major determinants (vegetation cover, climate, soil properties) are considered. We propose guidelines for environmental policy actions and argue that taxonomical and functional diversity should be considered simultaneously for monitoring purposes.},

Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial--fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.},

This work provided a quantitative framework for understanding the ecological processes governing the diversity of species on oceanic islands.

Recent work is showing how immigration, speciation, and extinction respond to the phases of emergence, development, and submergence in oceanic islands. Science, this issue p. eaam8326 Islands provide classic model biological systems. We review how growing appreciation of geoenvironmental dynamics of marine islands has led to advances in island biogeographic theory accommodating both evolutionary and ecological phenomena. Recognition of distinct island geodynamics permits general models to be developed and modified to account for patterns of diversity, diversification, lineage development, and trait evolution within and across island archipelagos. Emergent patterns of diversity include predictable variation in island species-area relationships, progression rule colonization from older to younger land masses, and syndromes including loss of dispersability and secondary woodiness in herbaceous plant lineages. Further developments in Earth system science, molecular biology, and trait data for islands hold continued promise for unlocking many of the unresolved questions in evolutionary biology and biogeography.}}

abstract={Plant colonization of islands may be limited by the availability of symbionts, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which have limited dispersal ability compared to ectomycorrhizal and ericoid (EEM) as well as orchid mycorrhizal (ORC) fungi. We tested for such differential island colonization within contemporary angiosperm floras worldwide. We found evidence that AM plants experience a stronger mycorrhizal filter than other mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal (NM) plant species, with decreased proportions of native AM plant species on islands relative to mainlands. This effect intensified with island isolation, particularly for non-endemic plant species. The proportion of endemic AM plant species increased with island isolation, consistent with diversification filling niches left open by the mycorrhizal filter. We further found evidence of humans overcoming the initial mycorrhizal filter. Naturalized floras showed higher proportions of AM plant species than native floras, a pattern that increased with increasing isolation and land-use intensity. This work provides evidence that mycorrhizal fungal symbionts shape plant colonization of islands and subsequent diversification.},

abstract={Microbes, similar to plants and animals, exhibit biogeographic patterns. However, in contrast with the considerable knowledge on the island biogeography of higher organisms, we know little about the distribution of microorganisms within and among islands. Here, we explored insular soil bacterial and fungal biogeography and underlying mechanisms, using soil microbiota from a group of land-bridge islands as a model system. Similar to island species-area relationships observed for many macroorganisms, both island-scale bacterial and fungal diversity increased with island area; neither diversity, however, was affected by island isolation. By contrast, bacterial and fungal communities exhibited strikingly different assembly patterns within islands. The loss of bacterial diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the systematic decline of diversity within samples, whereas the loss of fungal diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the homogenization of community composition among samples. Lower soil moisture limited within-sample bacterial diversity, whereas smaller spatial distances among samples restricted among-sample fungal diversity, on smaller islands. These results indicate that among-island differences in habitat quality generate the bacterial island species-area relationship, whereas within-island dispersal limitation generates the fungal island species-area relationship. Together, our study suggests that different mechanisms underlie similar island biogeography patterns of soil bacteria and fungi.},

To identify and investigate the effects of the economic development applied over the last years, statistical data on forests, rangelands, livestock, agricultural lands and human population have been collected from the village communities and the towns included in the study area and analysed. Evolution of the population indicates a 47\% and a 36\% decrease in the number of inhabitants in the mountainous and hilly communities, respectively, as opposed to an 8.7\% increase in the plain communities from 1951 to 1991. This depopulation of the mountainous area has led to the abondonment of the traditional land uses in the uplands at the same time as the intensification of agriculture in the lowlands, which has involved the development of tree monocultures, use of artificial fertilizer irrigation and spraying over large areas (18.8\% of the total area is cultivated land). On the other hand 1.75\% of the area is residential, with massive commercial tourist development leading to all kinds of intrusive and discordant buildings. Forestry has limited importance as an economic activity, even though land classified as forest occupies 20.9\% of the whole area. Livestock grazing is a dominant activity on all wildlands (57.6\% are classified as rangelands) including forest. There was a 71\% increase in the number of livestock from 1981 to 1991 giving a 50\% increase in the stocking rate (animals ha-1 year-1). Overstocking, coupled with free and uncontrolled grazing as well as with frequent pastoral wildfires, has resulted in severe degradation.}

In order to investigate potential interactions between microbial taxa, network analysis of significant taxon co-occurrence patterns may help to decipher the structure of complex microbial communities across spatial or temporal gradients. Here, we calculated associations between microbial taxa and applied network analysis approaches to a 16S rRNA gene barcoded pyrosequencing dataset containing >160{\thinspace}000 bacterial and archaeal sequences from 151 soil samples from a broad range of ecosystem types. We described the topology of the resulting network and defined operational taxonomic unit categories based on abundance and occupancy (that is, habitat generalists and habitat specialists). Co-occurrence patterns were readily revealed, including general non-random association, common life history strategies at broad taxonomic levels and unexpected relationships between community members. Overall, we demonstrated the potential of exploring inter-taxa correlations to gain a more integrated understanding of microbial community structure and the ecological rules guiding community assembly.},

Located in the White Mountains of Crete, Asi Gonia peat bog constitutes an exceptional 2000-years-long sedimentary archive of environmental change. In this study, we document the making of the White Mountains landscape and assess human impact on ecosystem trajectories. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction is based on high-resolution analyses of sediment, pollen, dung fungal spores and charcoal obtained from a 6-m core collected from the bog. Multiproxy analyses and a robust chronological control have shed light on anthropogenic and natural processes that have driven ecological changes, giving rise to the present-day Mediterranean ecosystem. Our results suggest that sediment accumulation began during the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman period, likely due to watershed management. The evolution of the peat bog as well as vegetation dynamics in the surrounding area were linked to past climate changes but were driven by human activities, among which breeding was of great importance. Charcoal analysis reveals that fire was largely used for the construction and maintenance of sylvo-agropastoral areas. Pollen data allow the identification of three main vegetation assemblages: 1) evergreen oak forest (before ca. 850 AD), 2) heather maquis (ca. 850 to 1870 AD), 3) phrygana/steppe landscape. Rapid changes between phases in vegetation development are associated with tipping-points in ecosystem dynamics resulting from anthropogenic impact. The modern ecosystem did not get established until the 20th century, and it is characterized by biodiversity loss along with a dramatic drying of the peat bog.},

These questions concern their geographic and phylogenetic origin, how and when they reached the island, the number of valid species, how, when and why each species became extinct and, finally, the possible effect of the phenomenon of dwarfism on each species. (Dwarfism is characteristic of large mammals in insular faunas.) In addition to the available data, which we have reviewed, cross-checked and updated, we describe new fossil elephant material found in the interior of the island, at an altitude of 1000 m above sea level. Using this revised data set, we propose to (1) retain the separate taxonomic status of the dwarf elephant Mammuthus creticus; and (2) join all the described specimens of larger size under the new subspecies name Elephas antiquus creutzburgi. Moreover, in the light of the new approaches that have been attempted for the fossil elephants in other localities of the Mediterranean region, we try to solve and at least explore the mentioned problems and identify the remaining gaps in our knowledge which need to be filled in order to obtain a complete picture of the natural history of the elephants on Crete.}

For this purpose, we establish the first centennial tree-ring chronology for the species, and the first ever tree-ring chronology for a broadleaved species on Crete. We demonstrate the strong sensitivity of Z. abelicea towards precipitation and drought in late spring to early summer and the absence of a significant response to abundant precipitation occurring during winter or early spring. Whereas the late spring sensitivity is strong and consistent through time, the species seems to be experiencing a loss of signal towards early summer conditions since the 1970s, interpreted as an earlier cessation of cambial activity due to the increase in summer drought conditions on Crete. However, despite a reduced vegetative period, no significant decrease in radial growth of Z. abelicea was observed in the tree-ring series for the last decades, thus highlighting the capacity of Z. abelicea to withstand changing environmental conditions.}

ABSTRACT = {Human-induced biodiversity loss has been accelerating since the industrial revolution. The climate change impacts will severely alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns at all scales, leading to biotic homogenization. Due to underfunding, a climate smart, conservation-prioritization scheme is needed to optimize species protection. Spatial phylogenetics enable the identification of endemism centers and provide valuable insights regarding the eco-evolutionary and conservation value, as well as the biogeographical origin of a given area. Many studies exist regarding the conservation prioritization of mainland areas, yet none has assessed how climate change might alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of an island biodiversity hotspot. Thus, we conducted a phylogenetically informed, conservation prioritization study dealing with the effects of climate change on Crete plant diversity and biogeographical patterns. Using several macroecological analyses, we identified the current and future endemism centers and assessed the impact of climate change on the biogeographical patterns in Crete. The highlands of Cretan mountains have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity, providing important ecosystem services. Historical processes seem to have driven diversification and endemic species distribution in Crete. Due to the changing climate and the subsequent biotic homogenization, Crete unique bioregionalization, which strongly reminiscent the spatial configuration of the Pliocene/Pleistocene Cretan paleo-islands, will drastically change. The emergence of the Anthropocene era calls for the prioritization of biodiversity-rich areas, serving as mixed-endemism centers, with high overlaps among protected areas and climatic refugia.},

By sequencing high-resolution DNA markers in over 4000 topsoil samples from natural and human-altered ecosystems across all continents, we illustrate the distributions and drivers of different levels of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of fungi and their ecological groups. We show the impact of precipitation and temperature interactions on local fungal species richness (alpha diversity) across different climates. Our findings reveal how temperature drives fungal compositional turnover (beta diversity) and phylogenetic diversity, linking them with regional species richness (gamma diversity). We integrate fungi into the principles of global biodiversity distribution and present detailed maps for biodiversity conservation and modeling of global ecological processes. Water–energy balance defines fungal alpha diversity, while energy variability links phylogenetic, beta, and gamma diversity.}}

abstract = {Abstract Aim Organisms on our planet form spatially congruent and functionally distinct communities, which at large geographical scales are called “biomes”. Understanding their pattern and function is vital for sustainable use and protection of biodiversity. Current global terrestrial biome classifications are based primarily on climate characteristics and functional aspects of plant community assembly. These and other existing biome schemes do not take account of soil organisms, including highly diverse and functionally important microbial groups. We aimed to define large-scale structure in the diversity of soil microbes (soil microbiomes), pinpoint the environmental drivers shaping it and identify resemblance and mismatch with existing terrestrial biome schemes. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Soil eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Methods We collected soil samples from natural environments world-wide, incorporating most known terrestrial biomes. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize soil biotic communities and k-means clustering to define soil microbiomes describing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic and prokaryotic groups. We used climatic data and soil variables measured in the field to identify the environmental variables shaping soil microbiome structure. Results We recorded strong correlations among fungal, bacterial, archaeal, plant and animal communities, defined a system of global soil microbiomes (producing seven biome types for microbial eukaryotes and six biome types for prokaryotes) and showed that these are typically structured by pH alongside temperature. None of the soil microbiomes are directly paralleled by any current terrestrial biome scheme, with mismatch most substantial for prokaryotes and for microbial eukaryotes in cold climates; nor do they consistently distinguish grassland and forest ecosystems. Main conclusions Existing terrestrial biome classifications represent a limited surrogate for the large-scale diversity patterns of microbial soil organisms. We show that empirically defined soil microbiomes are attainable using metabarcoding and statistical clustering approaches and suggest that they can have wide application in theoretical and applied biodiversity research.},

abstract = {Summary The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a globally distributed group of soil organisms that play critical roles in ecosystem function. However, the ecological niches of individual AM fungal taxa are poorly understood. We collected>300 soil samples from natural ecosystems worldwide and modelled the realised niches of AM fungal virtual taxa (VT; approximately species-level phylogroups). We found that environmental and spatial variables jointly explained VT distribution worldwide, with temperature and pH being the most important abiotic drivers, and spatial effects generally occurring at local to regional scales. While dispersal limitation could explain some variation in VT distribution, VT relative abundance was almost exclusively driven by environmental variables. Several environmental and spatial effects on VT distribution and relative abundance were correlated with phylogeny, indicating that closely related VT exhibit similar niche optima and widths. Major clades within the Glomeraceae exhibited distinct niche optima, Acaulosporaceae generally had niche optima in low pH and low temperature conditions, and Gigasporaceae generally had niche optima in high precipitation conditions. Identification of the realised niche space occupied by individual and phylogenetic groups of soil microbial taxa provides a basis for building detailed hypotheses about how soil communities respond to gradients and manipulation in ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract={Fungi are highly important biotic components of terrestrial ecosystems, but we still have a very limited understanding about their diversity and distribution. This data article releases a global soil fungal dataset of the Global Soil Mycobiome consortium (GSMc) to boost further research in fungal diversity, biogeography and macroecology. The dataset comprises 722,682 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) derived from PacBio sequencing of full-length ITS and 18S-V9 variable regions from 3200 plots in 108 countries on all continents. The plots are supplied with geographical and edaphic metadata. The OTUs are taxonomically and functionally assigned to guilds and other functional groups. The entire dataset has been corrected by excluding chimeras, index-switch artefacts and potential contamination. The dataset is more inclusive in terms of geographical breadth and phylogenetic diversity of fungi than previously published data. The GSMc dataset is available over the PlutoF repository.},

abstract = {Summary Soil is a non-renewable resource that requires constant monitoring to prevent its degradation and promote its sustainable management. The Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey Soil (LUCAS Soil) is an extensive and regular topsoil survey that is carried out across the European Union to derive policy-relevant statistics on the effect of land management on soil characteristics. Approximately 45 000 soil samples have been collected from two time-periods, 2009-2012 and 2015. A new sampling series will be undertaken in 2018, with new measurements included. The organization for the 2018 sampling campaign represents an opportunity to summarize past LUCAS Soil achievements and present its future objectives. In 2009-2012 and 2015, LUCAS Soil surveys targeted physicochemical properties, including pH, organic carbon, nutrient concentrations and cation exchange capacity. Data from 2009-2012 (ca. 22 000 points) and derived output (more than 20 maps) are available freely from the European Soil Data Centre website. Analyses of samples collected during 2015 are ongoing and data will be available at the end of 2017. In the 2018 LUCAS Soil sampling campaign, additional properties, including bulk density, soil biodiversity, specific measurements for organic-rich soil and soil erosion will be measured. Here we present the current dataset (LUCAS Soil 2009-2012 and 2015), its potential for reuse and future development plans (LUCAS Soil 2018 and over). LUCAS Soil represents the largest harmonized open-access dataset of topsoil properties available for the European Union at the global scale. It was developed as an expandable resource, with the possibility to add new properties and sampling locations during successive sampling campaigns. Data are available to the scientific community and decision makers, thus contributing to both research and the development of the land-focused policy agenda. Highlights LUCAS Soil consists of soil physicochemical and biological properties data from Europe. Harmonized and open-access dataset allowing inclusion of soil in large-scale inter-disciplinary assessments. LUCAS Soil has a broad pool of users from scientists to policy makers, and applications from map validation to modelling. LUCAS Soil confirms the need for open-access and a large-scale dataset for soil properties.},

 abstract = {
            
               Background
               Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is the current standard method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. Here we introduce a normalization method for species count data called scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) and demonstrate its suitability for the analysis of microbial communities.
            
            
               Methods
               SRS consists of two steps. In the scaling step, the counts for all species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of scaled counts equals the selected total number of counts C\textsubscript{min}. The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain unchanged. In the subsequent ranked subsampling step, non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that minimizes subsampling error with regard to the population structure (relative frequencies of species or OTUs) while keeping the total number of counts equal C\textsubscript{min}. SRS and rarefying were compared by normalizing a test library representing a soil bacterial community. Common parameters of biodiversity and population structure (Shannon index \textit{H}, species richness, species composition, and relative abundances of OTUs) were determined for libraries normalized to different size by rarefying as well as SRS with 10,000 replications each. An implementation of SRS in R is available for download (https://doi.org/10.20387/BONARES-2657-1NP3).
            
            
               Results
               SRS showed greater reproducibility and preserved OTU frequencies and alpha diversity better than rarefying. The variance in Shannon diversity increased with the reduction of the library size after rarefying but remained zero for SRS. Relative abundances of OTUs strongly varied among libraries generated by rarefying, whereas libraries normalized by SRS showed only negligible variation. Bray-Curtis index of dissimilarity among replicates of the same library normalized by rarefying revealed a large variation in species composition, which reached complete dissimilarity (not a single OTU shared) among some libraries rarefied to a small size. The dissimilarity among replicated libraries normalized by SRS remained negligibly low at each library size. The variance in dissimilarity increased with the decreasing library size after rarefying, whereas it remained either zero or negligibly low after SRS.
            
            
               Conclusions
               Normalization of OTU or species counts by scaling with ranked subsampling preserves the original community structure by minimizing subsampling errors. We therefore propose SRS for the normalization of biological count data.

abstract={Differential abundance (DA) analysis of microbiome data continues to be a challenging problem due to the complexity of the data. In this article we define the notion of ``sampling fraction'' and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

abstract = {Abstract Data visualization is essential to discover patterns and anomalies in large high-dimensional datasets. New dimensionality reduction techniques have thus been developed for visualizing omics data, in particular from single-cell studies. However, jointly showing several types of data, for example, single-cell expression and gene networks, remains a challenge. Here, we present U-CIE, a visualization method that encodes arbitrary high-dimensional data as colors using a combination of dimensionality reduction and the CIELAB color space to retain the original structure to the extent possible. U-CIE first uses UMAP to reduce high-dimensional data to three dimensions, partially preserving distances between entities. Next, it embeds the resulting three-dimensional representation within the CIELAB color space. This color model was designed to be perceptually uniform, meaning that the Euclidean distance between any two points should correspond to their relative perceptual difference. Therefore, the combination of UMAP and CIELAB thus results in a color encoding that captures much of the structure of the original high-dimensional data. We illustrate its broad applicability by visualizing single-cell data on a protein network and metagenomic data on a world map and on scatter plots.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970-2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5-15\% (0.07-0.17C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying \&gt;30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent “axes of variation” shaped by markedly different processes.}}

Also, the EU's Farm to Fork Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan aim for soil protection. However, the status of soil biodiversity protection has not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we explored regulatory, incentive-based and knowledge-based instruments and strategic policy documents at the EU and national levels to determine whether they adequately protect soil biodiversity. Our review of 507 literature references concluded that only eight EU member states explicitly address threats to soil biodiversity in 14 regulatory instruments while 13 countries mainly focus on implicit threats to soil biodiversity, whereas six countries do not consider soil biodiversity. At the EU level, current directives and regulations only tackle individual threats to soil biodiversity. An EU-wide, legally binding protection could ensure a standardised minimum level of soil biodiversity protection while preventing surging costs of not acting. The EU Soil Health Law foreseen for 2023 could couple land management practices beneficial for soil biodiversity with incentive-based instruments. Simultaneously, models should be designed to predict soil biodiversity, considering soil biodiversity's spatial and temporal heterogeneity.}

abstract = {Soil is an immense habitat for diverse organisms across the tree of life, but just how many organisms live in soil is surprisingly unknown. Previous efforts to enumerate soil biodiversity consider only certain types of organisms (e.g., animals) or report values for diverse groups without partitioning species that live in soil versus other habitats. Here, we reviewed the biodiversity literature to show that soil is likely home to 59  15\% of the species on Earth. We therefore estimate an approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous estimates, and we include representatives from the simplest (microbial) to most complex (mammals) organisms. Enchytraeidae have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6\%), followed by fungi (90\%), Plantae (85.5\%), and Isoptera (84.2\%). Our results demonstrate that soil is the most biodiverse singular habitat. By using this estimate of soil biodiversity, we can more accurately and quantitatively advocate for soil organismal conservation and restoration as a central goal of the Anthropocene.}}

abstract = {Publication interests should not limit access to public data Despite some notable progress in data sharing policies and practices, restrictions are still often placed on the open and unconditional use of various genomic data after they have received official approval for release to the public domain or to public databases. These restrictions, which often conflict with the terms and conditions of the funding bodies who supported the release of those data for the benefit of the scientific community and society, are perpetuated by the lack of clear guiding rules for data usage. Existing guidelines for data released to the public domain recognize but fail to resolve tensions between the importance of free and unconditional use of these data and the right of the data producers to the first publication. This self-contradiction has resulted in a loophole that allows different interpretations and a continuous debate between data producers and data users on the use of public data. We argue that the publicly available data should be treated as open data, a shared resource with unrestricted use for analysis, interpretation, and publication.}}

abstract={Soils are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems1. However, unlike for plants and animals, a global assessment of hotspots for soil nature conservation is still lacking2. This hampers our ability to establish nature conservation priorities for the multiple dimensions that support the soil system: from soil biodiversity to ecosystem services. Here, to identify global hotspots for soil nature conservation, we performed a global field survey that includes observations of biodiversity (archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) and functions (critical for six ecosystem services) in 615 composite samples of topsoil from a standardized survey in all continents. We found that each of the different ecological dimensions of soils---that is, species richness (alpha diversity, measured as amplicon sequence variants), community dissimilarity and ecosystem services---peaked in contrasting regions of the planet, and were associated with different environmental factors. Temperate ecosystems showed the highest species richness, whereas community dissimilarity peaked in the tropics, and colder high-latitudinal ecosystems were identified as hotspots of ecosystem services. These findings highlight the complexities that are involved in simultaneously protecting multiple ecological dimensions of soil. We further show that most of these hotspots are not adequately covered by protected areas (more than 70{\%}), and are vulnerable in the context of several scenarios of global change. Our global estimation of priorities for soil nature conservation highlights the importance of accounting for the multidimensionality of soil biodiversity and ecosystem services to conserve soils for future generations.},

It is well known that land use intensification, climate change, environmental pollution, and mining activities degrade soil biodiversity. However, most current and intended policies on soil protection not only lack a holistic view on how biological, physical, and chemical components of soil health are integrated but also overlook how soils across national borders and continents are connected by human activities. The challenge is to use recent advancements in understanding the distribution and functional roles of soil biodiversity in developing policy on restoring and protecting soil health across borders. Thus, policy should focus not only on soils within a nation or union of nations but also on preventing negative footprints on each others soils.}}

abstract = {Abstract Process-based models describing biogeochemical cycling are crucial tools to understanding long-term nutrient dynamics, especially in the context of perturbations, such as climate and land-use change. Such models must effectively synthesize ecological processes and properties. For example, in terrestrial ecosystems, plants are the primary source of bioavailable carbon, but turnover rates of essential nutrients are contingent on interactions between plants and soil biota. Yet, biogeochemical models have traditionally considered plant and soil communities in broad terms. The next generation of models must consider how shifts in their diversity and composition affect ecosystem processes. One promising approach to synthesize plant and soil biodiversity and their interactions into models is to consider their diversity from a functional trait perspective. Plant traits, which include heritable chemical, physical, morphological and phenological characteristics, are increasingly being used to predict ecosystem processes at a range of scales, and to interpret biodiversity–ecosystem functional relationships. There is also emerging evidence that the traits of soil microbial and faunal communities can be correlated with ecosystem functions such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and greenhouse gas production. Here, we draw on recent advances in measuring and using traits of different biota to predict ecosystem processes, and provide a new perspective as to how biotic traits can be integrated into biogeochemical models. We first describe an explicit trait-based model framework that operates at small scales and uses direct measurements of ecosystem properties; second, an integrated approach that operates at medium scales and includes interactions between biogeochemical cycling and soil food webs; and third, an implicit trait-based model framework that associates soil microbial and faunal functional groups with plant functional groups, and operates at the Earth-system level. In each of these models, we identify opportunities for inclusion of traits from all three groups to reduce model uncertainty and improve understanding of biogeochemical cycles. These model frameworks will generate improved predictive capacity of how changes in biodiversity regulate biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Further, they will assist in developing a new generation of process-based models that include plant, microbial, and faunal traits and facilitate dialogue between empirical researchers and modellers.},

Relating the biodiversity patterns of soil ecological communities to soil biogeochemistry remains an important challenge for ecologists and earth system modelers. Crowther et al. review the state of science relating soil organisms to biogeochemical processes, focusing particularly on the importance of microbial community variation on decomposition and turnover of soil organic matter. Although there is variation in soil communities across the globe, ecologists are beginning to identify general patterns that may contribute to predicting biogeochemical dynamics under future climate change. Science, this issue p. eaav0550 Soil organisms represent the most biologically diverse community on land and govern the turnover of the largest organic matter pool in the terrestrial biosphere. The highly complex nature of these communities at local scales has traditionally obscured efforts to identify unifying patterns in global soil biodiversity and biogeochemistry. As a result, environmental covariates have generally been used as a proxy to represent the variation in soil community activity in global biogeochemical models. Yet over the past decade, broad-scale studies have begun to see past this local heterogeneity to identify unifying patterns in the biomass, diversity, and composition of certain soil groups across the globe. These unifying patterns provide new insights into the fundamental distribution and dynamics of organic matter on land.}}

However, microbes are the foundation of complicated soil food webs, with highly intricate and non-linear interactions among trophic groups regulating soil biogeochemical cycles. This food web includes fauna, which influence litter decomposition and the structure and activity of the microbial community. Given the early success of microbial-explicit models, should we also consider explicitly representing faunal activity and physiology in soil biogeochemistry models? Here we explore this question, arguing that the direct effects of fauna on litter decomposition are stronger than on soil organic matter dynamics, and that fauna can have strong indirect effects on soil biogeochemical cycles by influencing microbial population dynamics, but the direction and magnitude of these effects remains too unpredictable for models used to predict global biogeochemical patterns. Given glaring gaps in our understanding of fauna-microbe interactions and how these might play out along climatic and land use gradients, we believe it remains early to explicitly represent fauna in these global-scale models. However, their incorporation into models used for conceptual exploration of food-web interactions or into ecosystem-scale models using site-specific data could provide rich theoretical breakthroughs and provide a starting point for improving model projections across scales.}

Here, combining a global observational study with an experimental microcosm study, we provide evidence that soil biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) is significantly and positively associated with multiple ecosystem functions. These functions include nutrient cycling, decomposition, plant production, and reduced potential for pathogenicity and belowground biological warfare. Our findings also reveal the context dependency of such relationships and the importance of the connectedness, biodiversity and nature of the globally distributed dominant phylotypes within the soil network in maintaining multiple functions. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive association between plant diversity and multifunctionality across biomes is indirectly driven by soil biodiversity. Together, our results provide insights into the importance of soil biodiversity for maintaining soil functionality locally and across biomes, as well as providing strong support for the inclusion of soil biodiversity in conservation and management programmes.},

ABSTRACT={While vegetation has intensively been surveyed on mountain summits, limited knowledge exists about the diversity and community structure of soil biota. Here, we study how climatic variables, vegetation, parent material, soil properties, and slope aspect affect the soil microbiome on 10 GLORIA (Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine environments) mountain summits ranging from the lower alpine to the nival zone in Switzerland. At these summits we sampled soils from all four aspects and examined how the bacterial and fungal communities vary by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We found that mountain summit soils contain highly diverse microbial communities with a total of 10,406 bacterial and 6,291 fungal taxa. Bacterial a-diversity increased with increasing soil pH and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas fungal a-diversity did not change significantly. Soil pH was the strongest predictor for microbial b-diversity. Bacterial and fungal community structures exhibited a significant positive relationship with plant communities, indicating that summits with a more distinct plant composition also revealed more distinct microbial communities. The influence of elevation was stronger than aspect on the soil microbiome. Several microbial taxa responded to elevation and soil pH. Chloroflexi and Mucoromycota were significantly more abundant on summits at higher elevations, whereas the relative abundance of Basidiomycota and Agaricomycetes decreased with elevation. Most bacterial OTUs belonging to the phylum Acidobacteria were indicators for siliceous parent material and several OTUs belonging to the phylum Planctomycetes were associated with calcareous soils. The trends for fungi were less clear. Indicator OTUs belonging to the genera Mortierella and Naganishia showed a mixed response to parent material, demonstrating their ubiquitous and opportunistic behaviour in soils. Overall, fungal communities responded weakly to abiotic and biotic factors. In contrast, bacterial communities were strongly influenced by environmental changes suggesting they will be strongly affected by future climate change and associated temperature increase and an upward migration of vegetation. Our results provide the first insights into the soil microbiome of mountain summits in the European Alps that are shaped as a result of highly variable local environmental conditions and may help to predict responses of the soil biota to global climate change.}

With about 25\% of all land area, mountain regions are home to more than 85\% of the world’s species of amphibians, birds, and mammals, many entirely restricted to mountains. Biodiversity varies markedly among these regions. Together with the extreme species richness of some tropical mountains, this variation has proven challenging to explain under traditional climatic hypotheses. However, the complex climatic characteristics of rugged mountain regions differ fundamentally from those of lowland regions, likely playing a key role in generating and maintaining diversity. With ongoing global changes in climate and land use, the role of mountains as refugia for biodiversity may well come under threat.}}

abstract = {Abstract More than 200 years ago, Alexander von Humboldt reported that tropical plant species richness decreased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.},

Soils were analyzed for a number of properties, including physical and chemical soil properties, microbial activity and microbial communities that were investigated using culture-dependent (viable heterotrophic bacteria) and culture-independent methods (phospholipid fatty acid analysis, FISH). Alpine soils were characterized by significantly (P\\&lt;0.01) colder climate conditions, i.e. lower mean annual air and soil temperatures, more frost and ice days and higher precipitation, compared with subalpine soils. Microbial activity (soil dehydrogenase activity) decreased with altitude; however, dehydrogenase activity was better adapted to cold in alpine soils compared with subalpine soils, as shown by the lower apparent optimum temperature for activity (30 vs. 37 °C) and the significantly (P\\&lt;0.01–0.001) higher relative activity in the low-temperature range. With increasing altitude, i.e. in alpine soils, a significant (P\\&lt;0.05–0.01) increase in the relative amount of culturable psychrophilic heterotrophic bacteria, in the relative amount of the fungal population and in the relative amount of Gram-negative bacteria was found, which indicates shifts in microbial community composition with altitude.}",

abstract = {Microbial community responses to environmental change are largely associated with ecological processes; however, the potential for microbes to rapidly evolve and adapt remains relatively unexplored in natural environments. To assess how ecological and evolutionary processes simultaneously alter the genetic diversity of a microbiome, we conducted two concurrent experiments in the leaf litter layer of soil over 18 mo across a climate gradient in Southern California. In the first experiment, we reciprocally transplanted microbial communities from five sites to test whether ecological shifts in ecotypes of the abundant bacterium, Curtobacterium, corresponded to past adaptive differentiation. In the transplanted communities, ecotypes converged toward that of the native communities growing on a common litter substrate. Moreover, these shifts were correlated with community-weighted mean trait values of the Curtobacterium ecotypes, indicating that some of the trait variation among ecotypes could be explained by local adaptation to climate conditions. In the second experiment, we transplanted an isogenic Curtobacterium strain and tracked genomic mutations associated with the sites across the same climate gradient. Using a combination of genomic and metagenomic approaches, we identified a variety of nonrandom, parallel mutations associated with transplantation, including mutations in genes related to nutrient acquisition, stress response, and exopolysaccharide production. Together, the field experiments demonstrate how both demographic shifts of previously adapted ecotypes and contemporary evolution can alter the diversity of a soil microbiome on the same timescale.}}

abstract={Microbiome differential abundance analysis methods for two groups are well-established in the literature. However, many microbiome studies involve more than two groups, sometimes even ordered groups such as stages of a disease, and require different types of comparison. Standard pairwise comparisons are inefficient in terms of power and false discovery rates. In this Article, we propose a general framework, ANCOM-BC2, for performing a wide range of multigroup analyses with covariate adjustments and repeated measures. We illustrate our methodology through two real datasets. The first example explores the effects of aridity on the soil microbiome, and the second example investigates the effects of surgical interventions on the microbiome of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Here we applied this approach to >10,000 metagenomes collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth's continents and oceans, including metagenomes from human and animal hosts, engineered environments, and natural and agricultural soils, to capture extant microbial, metabolic and functional potential. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 12,556 novel candidate species-level operational taxonomic units spanning 135 phyla. The catalog expands the known phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and archaea by 44{\%} and is broadly available for streamlined comparative analyses, interactive exploration, metabolic modeling and bulk download. We demonstrate the utility of this collection for understanding secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential and for resolving thousands of new host linkages to uncultivated viruses. This resource underscores the value of genome-centric approaches for revealing genomic properties of uncultivated microorganisms that affect ecosystem processes.},

We also illustrate the pivotal role of uSGBs in augmenting soil microbiome's functional landscape and intra-species genome diversity, providing large proportions of the 43,169 biosynthetic gene clusters and 8545 CRISPR-Cas genes. Additionally, we determine that uSGBs contributed 84.6{\%} of previously unexplored viral-host associations from the SMAG catalogue.

Exploration of this vast sequence space has been limited to a comparative analysis against reference microbial genomes and protein families derived from those genomes. Here, to examine the scale of yet untapped functional diversity beyond what is currently possible through the lens of reference genomes, we develop a computational approach to generate reference-free protein families from the sequence space in metagenomes. We analyse 26,931 metagenomes and identify 1.17 billion protein sequences longer than 35 amino acids with no similarity to any sequences from 102,491 reference genomes or the Pfam database3. Using massively parallel graph-based clustering, we group these proteins into 106,198 novel sequence clusters with more than 100 members, doubling the number of protein families obtained from the reference genomes clustered using the same approach. We annotate these families on the basis of their taxonomic, habitat, geographical and gene neighbourhood distributions and, where sufficient sequence diversity is available, predict protein three-dimensional models, revealing novel structures. Overall, our results uncover an enormously diverse functional space, highlighting the importance of further exploring the microbial functional dark matter.},

	abstract = {{Invertebrate pests often show high morphological variation and wide environmental tolerances. Knowledge of how phenotypic variation is associated with environmental heterogeneity can elucidate the processes underpinning these patterns. Here we examine morphological variation and relative abundance along environmental gradients in a widespread agricultural pest, native to Australia, the wingless grasshopper Phaulacridium vittatum (Sj{\"o}stedt). We test for correlations between body size, wing presence, and stripe polymorphism with environmental variables. Using multiple regression and mixed-effects modeling, body size and stripe polymorphism were positively associated with solar radiation, and wing presence was positively associated with foliage projective cover (FPC). There were no associations between body size or morphological traits with relative abundance. However, relative abundance was positively associated with latitude, soil moisture, and wind speed, but was negatively associated with FPC. Therefore, sites with low relative abundance and high forest cover were more likely to contain winged individuals. Overall, our results suggest that environmental and climatic conditions strongly influence the relative abundance and the distribution of morphotypes in P. vittatum, which is likely to affect dispersal and fitness in different landscapes. This knowledge is useful for informing how environmental change might influence the future spread and impact of this agricultural pest.}},

We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32{\%}) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating (\~{}1960--2005) and decelerating (2006--2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Being nocturnal, hiding in prickly bushes and shrubs during the day, Eupholidoptera species in Crete and its neighbouring islands are easily overlooked, and until now our knowledge about their distribution was based on some thirty sightings across 11 species. In this paper results are presented of a study of Eupholidoptera specimens collected between 1987 and 2020 by hand-catches and pitfall and fermenting traps on the Greek islands of Crete, Gavdos, Gavdopoula, and Andikithira. Diagnostic features of all known species are presented and illustrated with stacked images. An updated key to all species is provided. Eupholidoptera francisae Tilmans &amp; Od{\'e}, sp. nov. from Andikithira and southwestern Crete and Eupholidoptera marietheresae Willemse &amp; Kotitsa, sp. nov. from Mt. Dikti are described. Female E. cretica, E. gemellata, and E. mariannae are described, and the female of E. astyla is redescribed. Bioacoustics for E. francisae Tilmans &amp; Od{\'e}, sp. nov., E. giuliae, and E. jacquelinae are presented for the first time. Eupholidoptera smyrnensis is reported for the first time from Crete. A substantial amount of new distribution data for Eupholidoptera species on Crete is presented. The current distribution pattern and first analyses of phylogeny based on molecular data of Eupholidoptera species on Crete are discussed in relation to paleogeographical events.},

	abstract = {Abstract Conservation `culturomics' analyses changes in word frequencies within large digital sources to gain conservation insights. Studies of mammals and birds have found little correlation between conservation need and research effort or popular interest. In this study, we examine research and public interest in 9355 potentially endangered insect species from the Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Using search counts from Google search, Google Scholar and Ngram as indicators of public and research interest (Internet salience), we found that Internet attention is negatively correlated with the level of threat faced by an insect species. All measures of Internet salience and research effort were highly correlated, and searches for an insect's scientific name were more likely if it had a common name. Since few past studies have incorporated phylogenetic information into their analyses, we used search counts and Twitter text content to study the phylogenetic signal of research interest across 870 insect families. Phylogenetic regressions demonstrate that species-rich families receive more searches, but research interest is not proportional to the size of a family. Phylogenetically distinct insect families receive fewer searches per family and per species. Our results suggest that many endangered insects, unlike vertebrates, have been largely ignored on the World Wide Web.},

@article{wagner2020insect,
	abstract = { Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines. This review also considers the status of vertebrate insectivores, reporting bias, challenges inherent in collecting and interpreting insect demographic data, and cases of increasing insect abundance. },

@article{venter2018bias,
	abstract = {Abstract To contribute to the aspirations of recent international biodiversity conventions, protected areas (PAs) must be strategically located and not simply established on economically marginal lands as they have in the past. With refined international commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity to target protected areas in places of ``importance to biodiversity,'' perhaps they may now be. We analyzed location biases in PAs globally over historic (pre-2004) and recent periods. Specifically, we examined whether the location of protected areas are more closely associated with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species or with areas of low agricultural opportunity costs. We found that both old and new protected areas did not target places with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species. Instead, they appeared to be established in locations that minimize conflict with agriculturally suitable lands. This entrenchment of past trends has substantial implications for the contributions these protected areas are making to international commitments to conserve biodiversity. If protected-area growth from 2004 to 2014 had strategically targeted unrepresented threatened vertebrates, >30 times more species (3086 or 2553 potential vs. 85 actual new species represented) would have been protected for the same area or the same cost as the actual expansion. With the land available for conservation declining, nations must urgently focus new protection on places that provide for the conservation outcomes outlined in international treaties.},

	abstract = {Slovenia has one of the most extensive Natura 2000 networks in Europe with 259 SAC's covering 31.4{\%} of the country. To determine how well does the current network cover the areas of high butterfly diversity and/or aggregation of the butterfly species of conservation concern, the data from the recent survey for a distribution atlas were used. Altogether 99,423 records of 173 species collated after 1979 were used. The data distribution is slightly biased towards SAC's, with 44.8{\%} of localities within them, most likely due to sparsely sampled urban areas and intensive farmland areas which are found only outside SAC's. The diversity and distribution of red listed species was evaluated at a 5 ×5 km grid square level. Additionally the importance of the size of the SAC's was compared to their butterfly species diversity. In general the high diversity areas also hold the largest aggregation of red listed species with core areas concentrated in SW Slovenia. The SAC's cover majority of areas with high diversity and the distribution of all but one threatened butterfly species. That species is Colias myrmidone, which is now considered extinct in Slovenia with no records after 1993. The most prominent areas with high conservation value in Slovenia not included in the SAC's network are the Koro{\v s}ka region, Gori{\v s}ka Brda region, lower Sava River valley and Slovenske Gorice region. The butterfly diversity in small SAC's is relatively high with increases in size only gradually increasing the species numbers, thus emphasizing the importance and conservation value of small SAC's for sustaining high butterfly diversity in Slovenia.},

	abstract = {We aim to unravel the biogeographic structuring of western Palaearctic longhorn beetles with focus on the location of different refugia, barriers to dispersal and postglacial range expansions with their particular filters. The interaction of different ecological features with these structures is analysed. The western Palaearctic was divided into 95 geographic entities. We produced presence-only matrices for all 955 Cerambycoidea species autochthonous to this area and derived species richness distributions and extracted faunal regions and faunal elements by cluster analyses and principal component analyses. Similar analyses were performed for sub-families and ecological groups. Longhorn beetles show a strong biogeographic structuring in the western Palaearctic. Species numbers strongly decrease to the north and west. Less mobile species and root feeders mostly contribute to the fauna of the Mediterranean region, whilst mobile species are more widespread. Feeders on broad-leaved trees dominate in western Europe, whilst feeders on coniferous trees are most important in northern Europe. Our results support multiple refugia in the Mediterranean region and underline the importance of Provence, Crimea and Crete as such refugia. Crete even might be an area of old endemism. The Atlanto- and the Ponto-Mediterranean regions are more strongly structured than assumed in classical biogeography. Mediterranean assemblages are mostly composed of non-flying species, root feeders and species with small distributions not found outside their glacial refugia. Tree feeders left their glacial retreats with their host plants. These range dynamics result in biogeographic structures with several dispersal barriers and filters composed of mountains, sea straits and climatic conditions.},

@article{tzanakakis2020challenges,
	abstract = {Crete, located in the South Mediterranean Sea, is characterized by long coastal areas, varied terrain relief and geology, and great spatial and inter-annual variations in precipitation. Under average meteorological conditions, the island is water-sufficient (967 mm precipitation; theoretical water potential 3425.89 hm3; and total water use 610 hm3). Agriculture is by far the greatest user of water (78{\%} of total water use), followed by domestic use (21{\%}). Despite the high average water availability, water scarcity events commonly occur, particularly in the eastern-south part of the island, driven by local climatic conditions and seasonal or geographical mismatches between water availability and demand. Other critical issues in water management include the over-exploitation of groundwater, accounting for 93{\%} of the water used in agriculture; low water use efficiencies in the farms; limited use of non-conventional water sources (effluent reuse); lack of modern frameworks of control and monitoring; and inadequate cooperation among stakeholders. These deficiencies impact adversely water use efficiency, deteriorate quality of water resources, increase competition for water and water pricing, and impair agriculture and environment. Moreover, the water-limited areas may display low adaptation potential to climate variability and face increased risks for the human-managed and natural ecosystems. The development of appropriate water governance frameworks that promote the development of integrated water management plans and allow concurrently flexibility to account for local differentiations in social-economic favors is urgently needed to achieve efficient water management and to improve the adaptation to the changing climatic conditions. Specific corrective actions may include use of alternative water sources (e.g., treated effluent and brackish water), implementation of efficient water use practices, re-formation of pricing policy, efficient control and monitoring, and investment in research and innovation to support the above actions. It is necessary to strengthen the links across stakeholders (e.g., farmers, enterprises, corporations, institutes, universities, agencies, and public authorities), along with an effective and updated governance framework to address the critical issues in water management, facilitate knowledge transfer, and promote the efficient use of non-conventional water resources.},

	abstract = {Understanding diversity patterns along environmental gradients and their underlying mechanisms is a major topic in current biodiversity research. In this study, we investigate for the first time elevational patterns of vascular plant species richness and endemism on a long-isolated continental island (Crete) that has experienced extensive post-isolation mountain uplift. We used all available data on distribution and elevational ranges of the Cretan plants to interpolate their presence between minimum and maximum elevations in 100-m elevational intervals, along the entire elevational gradient of Crete (0--2400 m). We evaluate the influence of elevation, area, mid-domain effect, elevational Rapoport effect and the post-isolation mountain uplift on plant species richness and endemism elevational patterns. Furthermore, we test the influence of the island condition and the post-isolation mountain uplift to the elevational range sizes of the Cretan plants, using the Peloponnese as a continental control area. Total species richness monotonically decreases with increasing elevation, while endemic species richness has a unimodal response to elevation showing a peak at mid-elevation intervals. Area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient. Mid-domain effect is not the underlying mechanism of the elevational gradient of plant species richness in Crete, and Rapoport's rule only partly explains the observed patterns. Our results are largely congruent with the post-isolation uplift of the Cretan mountains and their colonization mainly by the available lowland vascular plant species, as high-elevation specialists are almost lacking from the Cretan flora. The increase in the proportion of Cretan endemics with increasing elevation can only be regarded as a result of diversification processes towards Cretan mountains (especially mid-elevation areas), supported by elevation-driven ecological isolation. Cretan plants have experienced elevational range expansion compared to the continental control area, as a result of ecological release triggered by increased species impoverishment with increasing elevation.},

	abstract = {{The Aegean archipelago, as an `evolutionary laboratory of nature', is an ideal model for research in phylogeography. In this area, the darkling beetles of the genus Dendarus (distributed from Morocco to the Caucasus) exhibit a high level of diversity with 36 species, 27 of which are island endemics. However, their taxonomy is complex and unstable, having undergone continuous revision to address extensive morphological and ecological plasticity. Here, we examine the phylogenetic relationships of 23 species from Greece and Turkey, using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences and 61 morphological characters, to unveil their phylogeny in the Aegean. This helps to clarify phylogeographic scenarios and historical processes that shaped the observed patterns. The analyses reveal 13 distinct lineages with several para- and polyphyletic cases that correspond to three major phylogroups [south/south-east Aegean (D. foraminosus complex, D. rhodius, D. sporadicus, D. wettsteini); central to north Aegean, Turkey and mainland Greece (D. crenulatus, D. moesiacus group, D. sinuatus complex, D. stygius) and mainland Greece (D. messenius, D. paganettii)], indicating the need for further taxonomic re-evaluation. Lineage topology and phylogeography suggest a spatial and temporal sequence of geographic isolation, following either a vicariant or a dispersal model coincident with major palaeogeographic separations in the Aegean.}},

@article{triantis2010extinction,
	abstract = {Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species extinctions. However, there is typically a time-lag between the reduction in habitat area and the eventual disappearance of the remnant populations. These ``surviving but ultimately doomed'' species represent an extinction debt. Calculating the magnitude of such future extinction events has been hampered by potentially inaccurate assumptions about the slope of species--area relationships, which are habitat- and taxon-specific. We overcome this challenge by applying a method that uses the historical sequence of deforestation in the Azorean Islands, to calculate realistic and ecologically-adjusted species--area relationships. The results reveal dramatic and hitherto unrecognized levels of extinction debt, as a result of the extensive destruction of the native forest:>95\%, in<600 yr. Our estimations suggest that more than half of the extant forest arthropod species, which have evolved in and are dependent on the native forest, might eventually be driven to extinction. Data on species abundances from Graciosa Island, where only a very small patch of secondary native vegetation still exists, as well as the number of species that have not been found in the last 45 yr, despite the extensive sampling effort, offer support to the predictions made. We argue that immediate action to restore and expand native forest habitat is required to avert the loss of numerous endemic species in the near future.},

@article{stuessy2006anagenetic,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim  Plants in islands have often evolved through adaptive radiation, providing the classical model of evolution of closely related species each with strikingly different morphological and ecological features and with low levels of genetic divergence. We emphasize the importance of an alternative (anagenetic) model of evolution, whereby a single island endemic evolves from a progenitor and slowly builds up genetic variation through time. Location  Continental and oceanic islands. Methods  We surveyed 2640 endemic angiosperm species in 13 island systems of the world, both oceanic and continental, for anagenetic and cladogenetic patterns of speciation. Genetic data were evaluated from a progenitor and derivative species pair in Ullung Island, Korea, and Japan. Results  We show that the anagenetic model of evolution is much more important in oceanic islands than previously believed, accounting for levels of endemic specific diversity from 7\% in the Hawaiian Islands to 88\% in Ullung Island, Korea, with a mean for all islands of 25\%. Examination of an anagenetically derived endemic species in Ullung Island reveals genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism) variation equal or nearly equal to that of its continental progenitor. Main conclusions  We hypothesize that, during anagenetic speciation, initial founder populations proliferate, and then accumulate genetic variation slowly through time by mutation and recombination in a relatively uniform environment, with drift and/or selection yielding genetic and morphological divergence sufficient for the recognition of new species. Low-elevation islands with low habitat heterogeneity are highly correlated with high levels of anagenetic evolution, allowing prediction of levels of the two models of evolution from these data alone. Both anagenetic and adaptive radiation models of speciation are needed to explain the observed levels of specific and genetic diversity in oceanic islands.},

@article{stork2018how-many,
	abstract = { In the last decade, new methods of estimating global species richness have been developed and existing ones improved through the use of more appropriate statistical tools and new data. Taking the mean of most of these new estimates indicates that globally there are approximately 1.5 million, 5.5 million, and 7 million species of beetles, insects, and terrestrial arthropods, respectively. Previous estimates of 30 million species or more based on the host specificity of insects to plants now seem extremely unlikely. With 1 million insect species named, this suggests that 80\% remain to be discovered and that a greater focus should be placed on less-studied taxa such as many families of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera and on poorly sampled parts of the world. DNA tools have revealed many new species in taxonomically intractable groups, but unbiased studies of previously well-researched insect faunas indicate that 1--2\% of species may be truly cryptic. },

Using a novel approach aligned with IUCN Red List criteria, we conducted a continental-scale preliminary conservation assessment of 22,036 vascular plant species in tropical Africa. Our results underline the high level of extinction risk of the tropical African flora. Thirty-three percent of the species are potentially threatened with extinction, and another third of species are likely rare, potentially becoming threatened in the near future. Four regions are highlighted with a high proportion (\&gt;40\%) of potentially threatened species: Ethiopia, West Africa, central Tanzania, and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

@article{steinbauer2018accelerated,
	abstract = {Globally accelerating trends in societal development and human environmental impacts since the mid-twentieth century1--7 are known as the Great Acceleration and have been discussed as a key indicator of the onset of the Anthropocene epoch6. While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying8, 9, it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services.},

We also compare it empirically with contrasting expectations from hypotheses invoking higher speciation with area, temperature and species richness. Location Thirty-two insular and 18 continental elevational gradients from around the world. Methods We compiled entire floras with elevation-specific occurrence information, and calculated the proportion of native species that are endemic (`percent endemism') in 100-m bands, for each of the 50 elevational gradients. Using generalized linear models, we tested the relationships between percent endemism and elevation, isolation, temperature, area and species richness. Results Percent endemism consistently increased monotonically with elevation, globally. This was independent of richness--elevation relationships, which had varying shapes but decreased with elevation at high elevations. The endemism--elevation relationships were consistent with isolation-related predictions, but inconsistent with hypotheses related to area, richness and temperature. Main conclusions Higher per-species speciation rates caused by increasing isolation with elevation are the most plausible and parsimonious explanation for the globally consistent pattern of higher endemism at higher elevations that we identify. We suggest that topography-driven isolation increases speciation rates in mountainous areas, across all elevations and increasingly towards the equator. If so, it represents a mechanism that may contribute to generating latitudinal diversity gradients in a way that is consistent with both present-day and palaeontological evidence.},

The hotspots identification procedure was facilitated by the use of the MapInfoPro G.I.S. software. We mapped the known distribution of 424 endemic species on a digital map of southern Greece in 548 10 ×10 km2 grids. The total number of registrations (records per grid) is 3826 in 465 grids. Registrations are unevenly distributed in the five sub-regions of the study area, a fact that results from both the unequal collecting effort applied in each sub-region and their different levels of endemism. We first identified the hotspots for each individual taxonomic group, and then for the total species pool. Finally, we analyzed the species saturation pattern in order to find the minimum number of grids needed for the inclusion of 85{\%} of the total number of species. The most important hotspots are mostly at the higher mountains of the study area, especially on Taygetos and Idi Mts. We also give a brief evaluation of the performance of the four criteria used in the case of endemic species analyses.},

@article{sanchez-fernandez2008are-the-endemic,
	abstract = {One of the most serious environmental problems is the current acceleration in the rate of species extinction associated with human activities, which is occurring particularly rapidly in freshwaters. Here we examine whether endemic water beetles are effectively protected by existing conservation measures in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, a region of high diversity and intense human pressure. We used an exhaustive database for aquatic beetles in the region to address such issues. Firstly, we identify the most threatened endemic taxa using a categorization system to rank species according to their conservation priority or vulnerability. Of the 120 endemic species of water beetles used in the analysis, only two (Ochthebius ferroi and Ochthebius javieri) were identified as being extremely vulnerable, 71 were highly vulnerable and 46 moderately vulnerable, with only a single species identified as having low vulnerability status. Since no Iberian species of aquatic Coleoptera has legal protection, the only conservation measure available for these species is the extent to which they occur in protected areas. Here we identify distributional hotspots for threatened endemic species, and evaluate the extent to which these are already included in the Natura 2000 network in Spain and Portugal. Despite a high degree of concordance between hotspots and Natura 2000 sites, the distribution of four species falls completely outside the network. The analysis also reveals that Natura 2000 fails to protect saline water bodies, despite their high conservation interest and narrow global distribution. The picture revealed here with water beetles is likely to be similar for others groups of freshwater macroinvertebrates, since Coleoptera are known to be good surrogates of aquatic biodiversity in the region. Finally, the degree of protection provided via Natura 2000, and the utility of red lists are discussed.},

@article{sanchez-bayo2019worldwide,
	abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40{\%} of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

@article{salata2020how-estimated,
	abstract = {Defining biodiversity conservation goals requires representative and reliable data. However, data collected with the use of different methods can lead to divergent conclusions. Regardless of the high level of biodiversity of Mediterranean habitats, very little attention was paid in developing methods allowing rapid and scalable estimation of their richness. This study aims to recognize and explain the differences in performance of two methods: pitfall traps (PTM) and a complementary method based on hand collecting (HCM), in surveys of ants in the Mediterranean. We compared the results of applying both methods in three habitats in relation to α-, β-, and γ-diversity, and functional traits of species, i.e. Webber's length (WL), nesting preferences, and evolutionary origin. Mean species number per HCM was significantly higher than per PTM sample. Spatial species turnover of HCM samples was higher than in PTM ones. However, assemblage dispersion did not differ. HCM detected a higher number of species and genera. WL differed significantly between HCM and PTM, and HCM recorded significantly more species in individual nesting guilds, regardless of considered habitat. HCM detected higher diversity of functional characteristic combinations of species. PTM detected fewer species with slightly larger body size and is useful in recognizing spatial species diversity patterns. HCM detected a higher number of species and produced more comprehensive results in identifying the functional diversity of ant assemblages. In conclusion, an integrated approach, described here as HCM, appears to be more suitable for heterogeneous Mediterranean habitats, especially when a survey aims at α-, β-, and γ-diversity assessments.},

@article{roth2020long-term,
	abstract = {Abstract Lentic freshwater organisms are influenced by a multitude of factors, including geomorphology, hydrology, anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Organisms that depend on patchy resources such as water beetles may also be sensitive to anthropogenic habitat degradation, like pollution, eutrophication, water level or management alteration. To assess composition and ecological trends in the water beetle communities of Central Europe, we sampled water beetles (Dytiscidae, Haliplidae, Noteridae) in 33 water bodies in Southern Germany from 1991 to 2018. We used manual, time-standardised capture during three periods: between 1991 and 1995, 2007 and 2008, and 2017 and 2018. During the 28-year survey period, we captured a total of 81 species. We found annual declines in both species number (ca −1\%) and abundance (ca −2\%). Also, community composition showed significant changes over time. The significant impact of pH on the community composition suggests that the recorded changes through time partly reflect natural succession processes. However, a pronounced decline of beetle species belonging to the moor-related beetle associations indicated that Central European water beetles are also threatened by non-successional factors, including desiccation, increased nitrogen input and/or mineralisation, and the loss of specific habitats. This trend to physiographical homogenisation resulted in corresponding community composition shifts. To effectively protect endangered species, conservation strategies need to be aimed at regularly creating new water bodies with mineralic bottom substratum, and maintenance of moor water bodies that represent late successional stages.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim To assess the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing biodiversity decline. We first test whether species richness of butterfly assemblages is higher within European Natura 2000 (N2000) sites than in their surroundings. We then assess temporal trends in butterfly richness and test whether these trends differ inside and outside the N2000 network. Location Germany, Europe. Methods We utilized generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) to analyse an 11-year data series on species richness of butterfly assemblages collected on 245 transects across Germany, located inside and outside N2000 sites, and comprising a total of 122 butterfly species. Results Butterfly species richness was highest inside N2000 protected areas, while outside it constantly declined with increasing distance from N2000 sites. We found an overall decline in species richness by 10\% within 11 years. This decline neither differed between transects located inside or outside the N2000 network nor varied with distance from N2000 sites. Main conclusions The higher species richness inside the N2000 network underlines their proper designation and their potential for the conservation of biodiversity. However, the current negative trend in butterfly species richness across Germany is not mitigated by the N2000 network, and we assume insufficient management or measures targeted at other organisms than butterflies as potential reasons.},

@article{raven2021agricultural,
	abstract = {Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11\% of the world's land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30\%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.},

Mountains play an array of roles for Earth's biodiversity and affect neighboring lowlands through biotic interchange, changes in regional climate, and nutrient runoff. The high biodiversity of certain mountains reflects the interplay of multiple evolutionary mechanisms: enhanced speciation rates with distinct opportunities for coexistence and persistence of lineages, shaped by long-term climatic changes interacting with topographically dynamic landscapes. High diversity in most tropical mountains is tightly linked to bedrock geology---notably, areas comprising mafic and ultramafic lithologies, rock types rich in magnesium and poor in phosphate that present special requirements for plant physiology. Mountain biodiversity bears the signature of deep-time evolutionary and ecological processes, a history well worth preserving.},

@article{poulakakis2015a-review,
	abstract = {Abstract We provide a review and synthesis of key findings in phylogeographic research on terrestrial animals in the Aegean archipelago (Greece) and surrounding regions (Greek mainland, southern Balkans and Asia Minor). A critical review of more than 100 phylogeographic articles on 76 animal genera (30 invertebrates and 46 vertebrates) that have been published so far for the region leads to the recognition of three types of distribution patterns: old `colonizers' diversified in the Aegean before the formation of the mid-Aegean Trench (MAT -- i.e. before 9 Mya), post-MAT colonizers that arrived to the Aegean in late Miocene and Pliocene and new colonizers that inhabited the region in the Pleistocene or even the Holocene. Several problems, mainly regarding the use of calibration points and/or molecular clock rates for clade chronology, have been identified in many analyses. Despite the large amount of phylogeographic work concerning the Aegean and surrounding regions, many groups remain unstudied (especially invertebrates, micro-organisms, fungi and plants), and many issues still remain unresolved. The relative roles of extinction, speciation, dispersal and vicariance, as well as the effects of adaptive and non-adaptive components of diversification, need further analyses with modern tools that can provide deeper insights. A more detailed reconstruction of the palaeogeography of the region is also of prime importance. The critical views presented herein may prove useful also for the evaluation of similar work in other regions.},

@article{potapov2020functional,
	abstract = {Abstract Deforestation and land-use change in tropical regions result in habitat loss and extinction of species that are unable to adapt to the conditions in agricultural landscapes. If the associated loss of functional diversity is not compensated by species colonizing the converted habitats, extinctions might be followed by a reduction or loss of ecosystem functions including biological control. To date, little is known about how land-use change in the tropics alters the functional diversity of invertebrate predators and which key environmental factors may mitigate the decline in functional diversity and predation in litter and soil communities. We applied litter sieving and heat extraction to study ground spider communities and assessed structural characteristics of vegetation and parameters of litter in rainforest and agricultural land-use systems (jungle rubber, rubber, and oil palm monocultures) in a Southeast Asian hotspot of rainforest conversion: Sumatra, Indonesia. We found that (1) spider density, species richness, functional diversity, and community predation (energy flux to spiders) were reduced by 57--98\% from rainforest to oil palm monoculture; (2) jungle rubber and rubber monoculture sustained relatively high diversity and predation in ground spiders, but small cryptic spider species strongly declined; (3) high species turnover compensated losses of some functional trait combinations, but did not compensate for the overall loss of functional diversity and predation per unit area; (4) spider diversity was related to habitat structure such as amount of litter, understory density, and understory height, while spider predation was better explained by plant diversity. Management practices that increase habitat-structural complexity and plant diversity such as mulching, reduced weeding, and intercropping monocultures with other plants may contribute to maintaining functional diversity of and predation services provided by ground invertebrate communities in plantations.},

	abstract = {The Atacama Desert at its margins harbors a unique biodiversity that is still very poorly known, especially in coastal fog oases spanning from Per{\'u} towards the Atacama coast. An outstanding species-rich fog oasis is the latitudinal fringe Paposo-Taltal, that is considered an iconic site of the Lomas formation. This contribution is the first to reveal the knowledge on arthropods of this emblematic coastal section. We used pitfall traps to study the taxonomic composition, richness, and abundance of terrestrial arthropods in 17 sample sites along a 100 km section of the coast between 24.5 and 25.5 southern latitude, in a variety of characteristic habitats. From a total of 9154 individuals, we were able to identify 173 arthropod species grouped into 118 genera and 57 families. The most diverse group were insects, with 146 species grouped in 97 genera and 43 families, while arachnids were represented by 27 species grouped into 21 genera and 14 families. Current conservation challenges on a global scale are driving the creation and evaluation of potential conservation sites in regions with few protected areas, such as the margins of the Atacama Desert. Better taxonomic, distributional, and population knowledge is urgently needed to perform concrete conservation actions in a biodiversity hotspot at a desert edge.},

@article{noroozi2018hotspots,
	abstract = {Conservation biology aims at identifying areas of rich biodiversity. Currently recognized global biodiversity hotspots are spatially too coarse for conservation management and identification of hotspots at a finer scale is needed. This might be achieved by identification of areas of endemism. Here, we identify areas of endemism in Iran, a major component of the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot, and address their ecological correlates. Using the extremely diverse sunflower family (Asteraceae) as our model system, five consensus areas of endemism were identified using the approach of endemicity analysis. Both endemic richness and degree of endemicity were positively related to topographic complexity and elevational range. The proportion of endemic taxa at a certain elevation (percent endemism) was not congruent with the proportion of total surface area at this elevation, but was higher in mountain ranges. While the distribution of endemic richness (i.e., number of endemic taxa) along an elevational gradient was hump-shaped peaking at mid-elevations, the percentage of endemism gradually increased with elevation. Patterns of endemic richness as well as areas of endemism identify mountain ranges as main centres of endemism, which is likely due to high environmental heterogeneity and strong geographic isolation among and within mountain ranges. The herein identified areas can form the basis for defining areas with conservation priority in this global biodiversity hotspot.},

@article{nhancale2011the-influence,
	abstract = {Systematic conservation planning is a widely used approach for designing protected area systems and ecological networks. This generally involves dividing the planning region into a series of planning units and using computer software to select portfolios of these units that meet specified conservation targets whilst minimising conservation costs. Previous research has shown that changing the size and shape of these planning units can alter the apparent spatial characteristics of the underlying data and thus influence conservation assessment results. However, this may be less problematic when using newer software that can account for additional constraints based on portfolio costs and fragmentation levels. Here we investigate these issues using a dataset from southern Africa and measure the extent to which changing planning unit shape, size and baseline affects the results of conservation planning assessments. We show that using hexagonal planning units instead of squares produces more efficient and less fragmented portfolios and that using larger planning units produces portfolios that are less efficient but more likely to identify the same priority areas. We also show that using real-world constraints in the analysis, based on reducing socio-economic costs and minimising fragmentation levels, reduces the influence of planning unit characteristics on the results and so argue that future studies should adopt a similar approach when investigating factors that influence conservation assessments.},

	abstract = {<p>Recently, the ``mountain-geobiodiversity hypothesis'' (MGH) was proposed as a key concept for explaining the high levels of biodiversity found in mountain systems of the Tibeto-Himalayan region (THR), which comprises the Qinghai--Tibetan Plateau, the Himalayas, and the biodiversity hotspot known as the ``Mountains of Southwest China'' (Hengduan Mountains region). In addition to the MGH, which covers the entire life span of a mountain system, a complementary concept, the so-called ``flickering connectivity system'' (FCS), was recently proposed for the period of the Quaternary. The FCS focuses on connectivity dynamics in alpine ecosystems caused by the drastic climatic changes during the past ca. 2.6 million years, emphasizing that range fragmentation and allopatric speciation are not the sole factors for accelerated evolution of species richness and endemism in mountains. I here provide a review of the current state of knowledge concerning geological uplift, Quaternary glaciation, and the main phylogeographic patterns (``contraction/recolonization,'' ``platform refugia/local expansion,'' and ``microrefugia'') of seed plant species in the THR. In addition, I make specific suggestions as to which factors future avenues of phylogeographic research should take into account based on the fundamentals presented by the MGH and FCS, and associated complementary paradigm shifts.</p>},

	abstract = {The shape and size of planning units (PUs) at the initial stage of regional systematic conservation planning (SCP) can strongly affect the final portfolio. In previous studies, the influence of PU shape and size has typically been considered for single study sites that include mainly natural land cover types. The impacts of PU shape and size in areas dominated by different land cover types have not been compared. We identified and compared the influence of three types of land uses, and shape and size of PUs in the efficiency of final portfolios in SCP. We show that PU shape is not significant for portfolio efficiency in all areas dominated by different land cover types, while smaller size of PUs would be more useful in the heterogeneous landscapes like agricultural and urban areas than the homogeneous landscapes like forest. We also show that the magnitude of the influences of PU shape and size differs depending on the dominant land cover type. Areas dominated by agricultural land cover were the most sensitive to the influence of PU shape and size, whereas areas dominated by forest were the least sensitive. Therefore, we recommend to planners to understand the different impacts of PU shape and size by the dominant land cover type and consider a similar approach with this study.},

	abstract = {The Anthropocene proposal suggested that the Earth may have entered a new geological epoch, in which human activity and climate change are influencing the environment at global scale. Arrival of the Anthropocene is bringing an unprecedented challenge to the biodiversity that is essential to humans, and enhancing many benefits of nature to human being. However, biodiversity loss is aggravating in the rhythm of inevitable change in the Anthropocene, and the adaptation of biodiversity to the anthropogenic disturbance seems unable to keep pace with the human activity and climate change. Therefore, re-examination of the assumptions and practices upon the current conservation endeavor are needed. We suggested that biodiversity conservation should be paid more attention to the response from biodiversity to the human activity and climate change in the Anthropocene. Thus, the concept of biodiversity arks in the Anthropocene is proposed, that is, biodiversity arks in the Anthropocene are the areas where vulnerable biodiversity is sheltered to alleviate human activity and buffered from climate change under the anthropogenic disturbance. The concept should be implemented for biodiversity conservation to fill gaps between our knowledge and build on successful conservation and sustainability in the Anthropocene. It will be certainly important to conservation policy instruction and management under climate change, especially the implementation of climate buffering zones preserving biodiversity in the face of warming climate.},

	abstract = {The numerous Mediterranean islands (>10,000) are very important from a biodiversity point of view, both in term of plant species (numerous endemics, presence of `climate relicts') and of ecosystems'assemblage. These patterns can be explained by complex interactions between a highly heterogeneous historical biogeography and ecological processes related to diverse island conditions. Furthermore, most of the ups and downs of this biodiversity were closely linked with human pressures which have changed many times through the long socio-ecological history of these island landscapes since the Neolithic period. At present, insular plant biodiversity and rural landscapes are threatened by diverse global environmental changes related to urbanization, habitat fragmentation, unsustainable tourism and other practices (e.g. overgrazing, forest fires), and by other more recent drivers such as climate warming and aridification, sea-level rise and biological invasions. Some of these impacts will be exacerbated on islands because of no (or highly limited) adjacent areas of expansion, notably on the smallest ones (i.e. size < ca. 1000 ha). With regards to the biome crisis facing the Mediterranean basin and induced by human activities, islands constitute key ecological systems and `current refugia'to ensure the long-term preservation of coastal plant biodiversity. They also represent fascinating ecological systems to disentangle the role of environmental versus human pressures on spatially simplified communities of the Mediterranean coastal areas. Future detailed studies of these `natural island microcosms'could greatly improve our knowledge of the functional and evolutionary processes induced by rapid environmental changes in this region.},

@article{medail1997hot-spots,
	abstract = {{$[$}Due to the increase of human impact on the world scale, there is an urgent need to identify the sectors of the greatest biodiversity that are also the most endangered. Examination of the plant biodiversity of the five regions with a mediterranean climate (SW Australia, the Cape region of South Africa, California, mediterranean Chile, and the Mediterranean basin) clearly demonstrates their key role in the world context. The delimitation and definition of 10 red alert areas or "hot-spots" situated in the Mediterranean basin and in Macaronesia are explained in detail. The 10 sectors identified are: the Canary Islands and Madeira, the High and Middle Atlas mountains, the Baetic-Rifan complex, the Maritime and Ligurian Alps, the Tyrrhenian Islands, Southern and Central Greece, Crete, Anatolia and Cyprus, the Syria-Lebanon-Israel area and, lastly, the Cyrenaic Mediterranean. There are two main centers of biodiversity in the Mediterranean basin: one in the west that includes the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, and one in the East that includes Turkey and Greece. This analysis demonstrates the uniqueness and fragility of the island habitats.{$]$}},

Reserves alone are not adequate for nature conservation but they are the cornerstone on which regional strategies are built. Reserves have two main roles. They should sample or represent the biodiversity of each region and they should separate this biodiversity from processes that threaten its persistence. Existing reserve systems throughout the world contain a biased sample of biodiversity, usually that of remote places and other areas that are unsuitable for commercial activities. A more systematic approach to locating and designing reserves has been evolving and this approach will need to be implemented if a large proportion of today's biodiversity is to exist in a future of increasing numbers of people and their demands on natural resources.},

	abstract = { Through the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the financial investments of the LIFE projects, Europe has become an experimental arena for biological conservation. With an estimated annual budget of €20 billion, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 has set an ambitious goal of classifying 30\% of its land and sea territory as Protected Areas and ensuring no deterioration in conservation trends and the status of protected species. We analysed LIFE projects focused on animals from 1992 to 2018 and found that investment in vertebrates was six times higher than that for invertebrates (€970 versus €150 million), with birds and mammals alone accounting for 72\% of species and 75\% of the total budget. In relative terms, investment per species towards vertebrates has been 468 times higher than that for invertebrates. Using a trait-based approach, we show that conservation effort is primarily explained by species' popularity rather than extinction risk or body size. Therefore, we propose a roadmap to achieve unbiased conservation targets for 2030 and beyond. },

@article{mammides2019european,
	abstract = {According to the European Union's most recent biodiversity assessment, many of its species are still threatened by human activities. To address biodiversity loss, the EU has adopted a series of legislation, which aim at protecting important habitats and species. In addition, as part of its most recent biodiversity strategy, the EU has set an ambitious conservation target, to halt biodiversity loss within the EU by the year 2020. While this is a laudable goal, paradoxically it may not be relevant to many of EU's species. This is because EU's conservation efforts are taxonomically biased, focusing mostly on the species listed in its legislation---mainly the annexes of the Birds and Habitats Directives. The annexes, though, over-represent vertebrates, especially birds. The taxonomic bias is also evident in the allocation of EU's conservation budget through the LIFE Programme---its main conservation funding instrument. Since the inception of the programme in 1992, the EU has funded more than 800 projects that targeted species. Half of those projects focused on birds while, for instance, only 7{\%} of them targeted invertebrates or plants. This, despite the fact that according to the European Red Lists there are more endangered invertebrates and plants within the EU than birds or mammals. The apparent taxonomic biases raise concerns regarding the conservation fate of the species belonging to taxonomically neglected groups, many of which are threatened. It is unlikely that the EU will succeed in truly halting the loss of its biodiversity if these taxonomic biases are not addressed.},

The project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) investigates insect communities in 21 nature reserves in Germany. All selected conservation sites border arable land, with agricultural practices assumed to influence insect populations. We taught citizen scientists how to manage Malaise traps for insect collection, and subsequently used a DNA metabarcoding approach for species identification. Vegetation surveys, plant metabarcoding as well as geospatial and ecotoxicological analyses will help to unravel contributing factors for the deterioration of insect communities. As a pioneering research project in this field, DINA includes a transdisciplinary dialogue involving relevant stakeholders such as local authorities, policymakers, and farmers, which aims at a shared understanding of conservation goals and action pathways. Stakeholder engagement combined with scientific results will support the development of sound policy recommendations to improve legal frameworks, landscape planning, land use, and conservation strategies. With this transdisciplinary approach, we aim to provide the background knowledge to implement policy strategies that will halt further decline of insects in German protected areas.},

	abstract = {Many countries identify lists of priority species for biodiversity conservation. These are developed using different criteria which can change over time. We argue that priority species need to be selected using both global and national criteria, and make recommendations for identifying global priority sites and species in the United Kingdom (UK). We compiled lists of 187 globally threatened species and 661 species endemic to the UK, and compared these with a UK national priority species list compiled from each of the four countries of the UK. We show that 55.1 {\%} of globally threatened species, and up to 87.5 {\%} of the UK's endemic species are not found on UK priority species lists. Compiling data on the distribution of the endemic and globally threatened species from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas, we show that 117 species are not recorded in any protected area designated for nature conservation and 43 of these species are apparently not recorded in any protected areas in UK. It was also found that only 31 globally threatened and 17 endemic species are notification features for Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the UK. These findings indicate that much of the focus of UK conservation is on nationally important populations of species, but globally important species are comparatively neglected. We propose that an assessment of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in the UK, using a global standard, could be used as a tool to identify sites containing globally significant populations of species which are not currently recognised.},

	abstract = {Summary
An assessment of the impact of global climate change on the water resources status of the island of Crete, for a range of 24 different scenarios of projected hydro-climatological regime is presented. Three ``state of the art'' Global Climate Models (GCMs) and an ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under emission scenarios B1, A2 and A1B provide future precipitation (P) and temperature (T) estimates that are bias adjusted against observations. The ensemble of RCMs for the A1B scenario project a higher P reduction compared to GCMs projections under A2 and B1 scenarios. Among GCMs model results, the ECHAM model projects a higher P reduction compared to IPSL and CNCM. Water availability for the whole island at basin scale until 2100 is estimated using the SAC-SMA rainfall--runoff model And a set of demand and infrastructure scenarios are adopted to simulate potential water use. While predicted reduction of water availability under the B1 emission scenario can be handled with water demand stabilized at present values and full implementation of planned infrastructure, other scenarios require additional measures and a robust signal of water insufficiency is projected. Despite inherent uncertainties, the quantitative impact of the projected changes on water availability indicates that climate change plays an important role to water use and management in controlling future water status in a Mediterranean island like Crete. The results of the study reinforce the necessity to improve and update local water management planning and adaptation strategies in order to attain future water security.},

Thus, we are far from reaching Aichi Biodiversity Target 2, i.e., assessing the extinction risk of most species. To that end, based on an extensive occurrence dataset, we performed an extinction risk assessment according to the IUCN Criteria A and B for all the endemic plant taxa occurring in Greece, one of the most biodiverse countries in Europe, in a phylogenetically-informed framework and identified the areas needing conservation prioritization. Several of the Greek endemics are threatened with extinction and fourteen endemics need to be prioritized, as they are evolutionary distinct and globally endangered. Mt. Gramos is identified as the most important conservation hotspot in Greece. However, a significant portion of the identified conservation hotspots is not included in any designated Greek protected area, meaning that the Greek protected areas network might need to be at least partially redesigned. In the Anthropocene era, where climate and land-use change are projected to alter biodiversity patterns and may force many species to extinction, our assessment provides the baseline for future conservation research, ecosystem services maintenance, and might prove crucial for the timely, systematic and effective aversion of plant extinctions in Greece.},

There is thus an urgent need to efficiently allocate the available conservation funds in an optimised conservation prioritization scheme. Identifying BH and endemism centres (EC) is therefore a valuable tool in conservation prioritization and planning. Even though Greece is one of the most plant species-rich European countries, few studies have dealt with the identification of BH or EC and none has ever incorporated phylogenetic information or extended to the national scale. Consequently, we are unaware of the extent that Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the Natura 2000 network efficiently protect Greek plant diversity. Here, we located for the first time at a national scale and in a phylogenetic framework, the areas serving as BH and EC, and assessed the effectiveness of the Greek SAC in safeguarding them. BH and EC are mainly located near mountainous areas, and in areas supposedly floristically impoverished, such as the central Aegean islands. A critical re-assessment of the Greek SAC might be needed to minimize the extinction risk of the Greek endemics, by focusing the conservation efforts also on the BH and EC that fall outside the established Greek SAC.},

Several studies exist regarding climate change impacts on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess climate change impacts on the biodiversity patterns of the endemic plants of Crete (S Aegean) and provide a case-study upon which a climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete. We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic refugia and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas (PAs) for protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index. The results revealed that high altitude areas of Cretan mountains constitute biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation and evolutionary value. Due to the escalator to extinction phenomenon, these areas are projected to become diversity death-zones and should thus be prioritised. Conservation efforts should be targeted at areas with overlaps among PAs and climatic refugia, characterised by high diversity and EDGE scores. This conservation-prioritisation planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future ecosystem services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.},

To bridge this gap, we identify the biogeographical modules (highly linked subgroups of islands and plant taxa) within the Aegean Archipelago. Location The Aegean Archipelago, Greece. Methods We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database including 1498 Aegean endemic and subendemic plant taxa distributed on 59 Aegean Islands and five adjacent mainland areas. Results The Aegean was divided into six biogeographical modules; the network was significantly modular. None of the modules displayed all four possible biogeographical roles (connectors, module hubs, network hubs, peripherals). Six new biogeographical regions in the Aegean were identified. Main conclusions The borders of the six biogeographical regions in the Aegean correspond well to the region's palaeogeographical evolution from the middle Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene. The Central Aegean acts as an ecogeographical filter for the distribution of several plant lineages across the Aegean Sea, while there seems to be a N--S-oriented biogeographical barrier in the Aegean corresponding to the palaeogeographical situation during the middle Ionian. These biogeographical barriers have been fundamental for both plants and animals.},

	abstract = {The socio-ecological system dominated by pastureland in the Asteroussia Mountains (Crete, Greece) was analyzed over a long time interval (1945--2010) to identify the most relevant system's characteristics and changes. Vegetation cover and land-uses have been quantified by analyzing aerial photographs exploring the whole study period. Soil characteristics have been assessed by carrying out an extensive field survey for the last reference year (2010) and by estimating the average soil loss for the past period using the PESERA soil erosion model validated by field measurements. Based on environmental, social and economic attributes, three major periods characterizing the socio-ecological system of Asteroussia Mountains have been distinguished. During the first and second period, the land was satisfactorily managed with moderate--low soil erosion rates despite the adverse (prevailing) soil, topographic and climate conditions for vegetation growth. The third time interval featured a rapid growth in the livestock density causing increased soil erosion rates, loss in plant productivity, and a generalized over-exploitation of natural resources. As a consequence, the desertification process has significantly increased in the last period. The analysis of the long-term evolution of socio-ecological system provided evidence to understand the main drivers of land degradation and to recommend mitigation policies specifically addressing Mediterranean pastureland.},

@article{klink2020meta-analysis,
	abstract = {Recent studies have reported alarming declines in insect populations, but questions persist about the breadth and pattern of such declines. van Klink et al. compiled data from 166 long-term surveys across 1676 globally distributed sites and confirmed declines in terrestrial insects, albeit at lower rates than some other studies have reported (see the Perspective by Dornelas and Daskalova). However, they found that freshwater insect populations have increased overall, perhaps owing to clean water efforts and climate change. Patterns of variation suggest that local-scale drivers are likely responsible for many changes in population trends, providing hope for directed conservation actions. Science, this issue p. 417; see also p. 368 Global changes in insect populations reflect both decline and growth. Recent case studies showing substantial declines of insect abundances have raised alarm, but how widespread such patterns are remains unclear. We compiled data from 166 long-term surveys of insect assemblages across 1676 sites to investigate trends in insect abundances over time. Overall, we found considerable variation in trends even among adjacent sites but an average decline of terrestrial insect abundance by ~9\% per decade and an increase of freshwater insect abundance by ~11\% per decade. Both patterns were largely driven by strong trends in North America and some European regions. We found some associations with potential drivers (e.g., land-use drivers), and trends in protected areas tended to be weaker. Our findings provide a more nuanced view of spatiotemporal patterns of insect abundance trends than previously suggested.},

	abstract = {Studies have reported widespread declines in terrestrial insect abundances in recent years1--4, but trends in other biodiversity metrics are less clear-cut5--7. Here we examined long-term trends in 923 terrestrial insect assemblages monitored in 106 studies, and found concomitant declines in abundance and species richness. For studies that were resolved to species level (551 sites in 57 studies), we observed a decline in the number of initially abundant species through time, but not in the number of very rare species. At the population level, we found that species that were most abundant at the start of the time series showed the strongest average declines (corrected for regression-to-the-mean effects). Rarer species were, on average, also declining, but these were offset by increases of other species. Our results suggest that the observed decreases in total insect abundance2 can mostly be explained by widespread declines of formerly abundant species. This counters the common narrative that biodiversity loss is mostly characterized by declines of rare species8,9. Although our results suggest that fundamental changes are occurring in insect assemblages, it is important to recognize that they represent only trends from those locations for which sufficient long-term data are available. Nevertheless, given the importance of abundant species in ecosystems10, their general declines are likely to have broad repercussions for food webs and ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Tropical high mountains are hosting important hot spots of biodiversity on small mostly remote areas. Recently, these precious ecosystems are under threat from land use change and climate change coupled with other local drivers of biodiversity loss. Along the East African Afroalpine ecosystems, area above the treeline have experienced long-term spatial isolation and extreme climatic conditions (climatic factors such as low mean temperature, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles and other energy-related factors) which lead to the formation of ``Sky Island'' like ecosystems that are rich in endemics and unique. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia are home to the largest tropical alpine plateau in Africa, with no spacious high summits that provide space for upward shift of species. Here, we studied plant species diversity and distribution patterns and tested potential future impacts of climate change induced warming on those patterns. This study is based on distribution data acquired from nested circular plots along an elevational gradient ranging from 2000m asl to the highest elevation (4385 m asl). We find hump shaped species richness patterns on both aspects, i.e. the dry north-eastern and the wet monsoon exposed south-western escarpment. In addition, the proportion of endemic species increases monotonically towards the summit on all slopes. Based on our data and literature, we project future climate impact for three regional warming scenarios (+2 $\,^{\circ}$C, + 3 $\,^{\circ}$C and + 4 $\,^{\circ}$C). We quantify the future range of 114 endemic plant species based on their current occurrence records applying a lapse rate of 0.6 $\,^{\circ}$C per 100 m of elevation. We find that future climate change would significantly alter species distribution patterns with pronounced impact on the unique ecosystems and endemic species restricted to the afroalpine plateau. Very likely this will be leading to the extinction of many endemic species.},

@article{karam-gemael2018why-be-red-listed,
	abstract = {The biodiversity crisis we live in, marked by high extinction rates, requires well-planned conservation efforts. To overcome this issue, red lists of threatened species are recognized as the main objective approach for evaluating the conservation status of species and therefore guiding conservation priorities. This work focuses on the Myriapoda (Chilopoda and Diplopoda) species listed in the Brazilian red list of fauna to enable discussion of the practical implications of red lists for conservation. Almost all myriapods assessed are endemic to Brazil (99 {\%}) and 73 {\%} are known from subterranean habitats only. Despite of 33 {\%} being recorded from protected areas (PAs), downgrading, degazettement or downsizing of PAs and intense and unregulated ecotourism represent great threats. The PAs network in Brazil tends to fail in conserving myriapod species. The number of data deficient species (42 {\%}) states the need of investing in ecological and taxonomic studies about the group, in order to fill in important knowledge gaps in species assessments nationally and globally. In this work we show that there is a lack of communication between national and global agencies concerning red lists, which results in a significant loss for science and for conservation. Despite investing in national and state red lists, individual countries must take the final step of submitting its data to IUCN global database, as significant international funding is available for IUCN red listed species conservation. Being one of the most diverse countries in the world, and facing the biggest cuts ever on national science funding, losing these important funding opportunities is a huge loss for Brazilian biodiversity conservation and for science. This study raises awareness on subterranean habitats conservation, due to its high endemism and fragility. Since the first edition of the Brazilian Red List in 1968, centipedes are now included for the first time, and millipedes for the second time. The presence of these myriapods in the list brings attention to the group, which usually receives little or no attention in conservation programs and environmental impact assessments. Rather than a specific case for Myriapoda and for Brazil, the points discussed here can be related to arthropods and the tropics, as the most biodiverse countries are emerging economies facing similar challenges in PAs network management, species extinction risks and science funding.},

@article{kaltsas2019overgrazed,
	abstract = {The phryganic and maquis shrublands form the most typical vegetal formations in the Eastern Mediterranean that since thousands of years have been subject to various types of anthropogenic disturbance, including grazing. We studied the impact of sheep and goat grazing on 50 assemblages of ground spiders (Araneae: Gnaphosidae) in phryganic, maquis and forest habitats from zero to 2000 m elevation on Crete, Greece using pitfall traps for one year at each sampling site. In total, 58 gnaphosid species and 16,592 individuals were collected. Cretan endemic Gnaphosidae were negatively affected by intensive grazing and, contrary to findings on other taxa studied on the island, they were sparse and rare throughout the study area. The species composition of gnaphosid assemblages was primarily determined by elevation. Trachyzelotes lyonneti, Urozelotes rusticus, Zelotes scrutatus, Anagraphis pallens and Berinda amabilis proved to be significant indicators of overgrazing. The vast majority of spiders belonging to synanthropic and nationally red-listed species were found in overgrazed sites. Despite theoretical expectations, while the average activity density decreased, the number of species, evenness, rarity, taxonomic, temporal and functional diversity (FRic) indices increased with increasing grazing intensity. This was mainly due to the nature of disturbance itself, which probably allows equibalanced low abundances of indigenous or synanthropic species, rather than overdominance of few, thus partly refuting the opportunistic species hypothesis (OSH). Ground spider assemblages in overgrazed sites comprised sparse populations of mostly rare, opportunistic species with different combinations of life-history traits that partly replace other species more commonly found in the less degraded sites. Species of these assemblages shorten their phenologies to minimize temporal co-occurrence with each other due to resource limitation. These distinct community patterns highlight ground spiders as good indicators of grazing pressure on Crete, on species and assemblage level. To conserve the indigenous and potentially endangered invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing including rested patches is important in order to maintain spatial variability and possibly lead to habitat restoration.},

@article{kaltsas2013ground,
	abstract = {Phrygana, maquis and subalpine shrublands are the most typical ecosystem types on the island of Crete. However, these formations are mostly mismanaged and poorly studied in terms of their fauna and the effect of long term land-use. We studied the impact of goat and sheep grazing on the diversity patterns of carabid beetles at 40 sites in relation to possible habitat uniqueness and geographic zonation. In total, 19,322 individuals belonging to 42 Carabidae species were identified. The composition of site assemblages was mainly determined by altitude. The six Cretan endemic species collected were widely distributed on the island and most of them were dominant. Species richness and equitability were significantly lower at overgrazed sites compared to areas with low grazing intensity. The diversity patterns of carabids were influenced by the level of grazing in each study area. As species richness and diversity were maximal under moderate/relatively high levels of grazing (hump-shaped pattern), our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Low tolerance of carabid taxa to intensive grazing was also ascertained through the significantly high values of temporal beta diversity at overgrazed sites, independent of local species richness. We conclude that Carabidae are good indicators of grazing pressure in Crete at assemblage level, rather than species-specifically. To maintain diversity and enhance niche space of invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing is essential.},

	abstract = {Millipedes are well-known for their limited dispersal abilities with species restricted to mountains, islands, and patches of forest being important models for formulating and testing biogeographic hypotheses. The order Spirostreptida is composed of nearly 1300 species distributed across the Afrotropical, Oriental, and Neotropical regions. The order is divided into the suborders Cambalidea and Spirostreptidea with the families Pseudonannolenidae (Cambalidea) and Spirostreptidae (Spirostreptidea) occurring in Brazil. To date, there have been no studies on the biogeography of Neotropical Spirostreptida. We employed a multi-approach analysis with Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity, Endemicity Analysis, and Infomap, to detect areas of endemism and patterns of distribution of the order in Brazil. Six areas of endemism are proposed for the 133 Brazilian species: Northern Serra Geral, Southeastern mountain ranges, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest zone, Eastern Cerrado and Serra do Espinha{\c c}o, Pantanal, and Southern Amazon and Cerrado zone. Most endemic areas fall within the Atlantic Forest, which has been previously shown to be an important area of endemism for many invertebrate taxa. The richest biomes are the Atlantic Forest with 75 species and the Cerrado with 55 species, while the least rich biomes are the Caatinga with six species and the Pampa with three species. Although the southeastern region of Brazil has the highest species richness, it also has the highest concentration of threatened species. Based on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, most Brazilian Spirostreptida are either endangered or critically endangered, with the highest concentration of endangered taxa occurring in the Atlantic Forest biome.},

	abstract = {Topographic change shapes the evolution of biodiversity by influencing both habitat connectivity and habitat diversity as well as abiotic factors like climate. However, its role in creating global biodiversity gradients remains poorly characterized because geology, climate and evolutionary data have rarely been integrated across concordant timescales. Here we show that topographic uplift over the last 3 million years explains more spatial variation in the speciation of all mammals and birds than do the direct effects of palaeoclimate change and both present-day elevation and present-day temperature. By contrast, the effects of topographic changes are much smaller than those of present-day temperatures in eroded areas. Together, our results stress that historical geological processes rather than traditionally studied macroecological gradients may ultimately generate much of the world's biodiversity. More broadly, as the Earth's surface continues to rise and fall, topography will remain an important driver of evolutionary change and novelty.},

In our research, we looked for a clearly distinguishable combination of hues of four colors - black, red, green, and blue -
which are frequently used in these circumstances. Red-green confusion people do not confuse all kinds of red and all
kinds of green. By selecting particular hues for each color, the ability to distinguish between the four colors should be
greatly improved.
Our study thus concluded that, by carefully selecting hues within the range of each color category, it is possible to
establish color-combinations which are easily distinguishable to people of all color-vision types in order to facilitate
visual communication.},

@article{hurlbert2007species,
	abstract = {Most studies examining continental-to-global patterns of species richness rely on the overlaying of extent-of-occurrence range maps. Because a species does not occur at all locations within its geographic range, range-map-derived data represent actual distributional patterns only at some relatively coarse and undefined resolution. With the increasing availability of high-resolution climate and land-cover data, broad-scale studies are increasingly likely to estimate richness at high resolutions. Because of the scale dependence of most ecological phenomena, a significant mismatch between the presumed and actual scale of ecological data may arise. This may affect conclusions regarding basic drivers of diversity and may lead to errors in the identification of diversity hotspots. Here, we examine avian range maps of 834 bird species in conjunction with geographically extensive survey data sets on two continents to determine the spatial resolutions at which range-map data actually characterize species occurrences and patterns of species richness. At resolutions less than 2$\,^{\circ}$ (≈200 km), range maps overestimate the area of occupancy of individual species and mischaracterize spatial patterns of species richness, resulting in up to two-thirds of biodiversity hotspots being misidentified. The scale dependence of range-map accuracy poses clear limitations on broad-scale ecological analyses and conservation assessments. We suggest that range-map data contain less information than is generally assumed and provide guidance about the appropriate scale of their use.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate warming is considered to be among the most serious of anthropogenic stresses to the environment, because it not only has direct effects on biodiversity, but it also exacerbates the harmful effects of other human-mediated threats. The associated consequences are potentially severe, particularly in terms of threats to species preservation, as well as in the preservation of an array of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Among the most affected groups of animals are insects---central components of many ecosystems---for which climate change has pervasive effects from individuals to communities. In this contribution to the scientists' warning series, we summarize the effect of the gradual global surface temperature increase on insects, in terms of physiology, behavior, phenology, distribution, and species interactions, as well as the effect of increased frequency and duration of extreme events such as hot and cold spells, fires, droughts, and floods on these parameters. We warn that, if no action is taken to better understand and reduce the action of climate change on insects, we will drastically reduce our ability to build a sustainable future based on healthy, functional ecosystems. We discuss perspectives on relevant ways to conserve insects in the face of climate change, and we offer several key recommendations on management approaches that can be adopted, on policies that should be pursued, and on the involvement of the general public in the protection effort.},

@article{harry2019protected,
	abstract = {Abstract Biodiversity assessments for conservation planning are often restricted to a limited set of species. This is also the case in the context of Natura 2000, where surveys focus strongly on vegetation and selected vertebrate species. Without cross-taxon congruence, however, this approach does not guarantee that the relevant aspects of biodiversity are appropriately represented. We here assess the diversity of vascular plants, carabid beetles and spiders in mountain grasslands of the European Alps. We address the questions whether there are distinct species assemblages in different habitats and whether these assemblages show sufficient cross-taxon congruence. Furthermore, we test whether habitats that are protected based on vegetation characteristics also inhabit an arthropod fauna with highest conservation value. We found only weak agreement in assemblage composition and no positive correlation in species richness across the three focal taxa. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between species richness of plants and carabids, indicating opposing taxon-specific responses to habitat differences and land use intensity. Species richness was higher at protected sites for plants, but not for carabids and spiders. This applied also to the subset of species with highest conservation value. Our results show that prioritisation of sites for conservation based solely on vegetational aspects does not necessarily coincide with important sites for arthropods. This calls for a multi-taxon approach in conservation planning to cover more of the endangered and range-restricted species. Species- and surrogate-based conservation efforts, like the Natura 2000 directive, should therefore be extended to embrace the diversity of arthropods.},

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76{\%}, and mid-summer decline of 82{\%} in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

	abstract = {Abstract Severe losses of insects have taken place over major parts of Europe. This negative trend is assumed to be largely the result of agricultural intensification. To analyse potential factors causing this loss of species, we assessed butterfly communities at 21 grassland patches. Seventeen of these were distributed across an agricultural landscape dominated by crop fields; four were embedded in two adjoining managed semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed environmental parameters such as patch size and habitat quality for each grassland patch. We further incorporated the surrounding land-cover considering different degrees of land-use intensity. We classified butterfly species into generalists and specialists according their ecological and behavioural characteristics. As in the managed semi-natural reference grasslands, species richness and abundance were higher in patches surrounded by extensively used grasslands and unsprayed crop fields, and lower in patches surrounded by sprayed crop fields. Furthermore, blossom density positively affected butterfly occurrence. Our data revealed that specialised butterfly species mainly occur in managed semi-natural grassland sites, and are largely absent from other grassland plots embedded in the agricultural matrix. Our study underlines the negative impacts of intense conventional agriculture on butterfly species richness and abundance and reveals the urgent need for more nature-friendly cultivation methods. In situ experiments may help to understand and disentangle single drivers causing this negative trend.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is declining, with major causes identified as habitat loss and a reduction of habitat quality. Recent studies have shown that particularly species with specific habitat demands are suffering in this way. Accordingly, habitat specialists have been nominated as umbrella species, which because they represent a much larger number of species, are thought best to fulfil the requirements of nature conservation. However, species which are ecologically intermediate between habitat specialists and generalists, and typically form networks of populations on adjoining habitats, might suffer even more severely under rapid habitat fragmentation than those specialists which had for a long time already occurred as discrete populations. Today, most of these formerly more widely distributed intermediate species also exist only as small and isolated populations which, because of their increasing geographic isolation, cannot counterbalance local extinctions by recolonisation. Furthermore, these species are mostly equipped with relatively high genetic diversity that is maintained by continual exchange of individuals between local populations. However, this high level of genetic variability frequently decreases after the collapse of population networks -- with negative effects on the viability of these species.

	abstract = {The Mediterranean islands are exceptionally rich in endemism, most of which is narrowly distributed. Conservation measures, such as protected areas, have been prioritised, mainly on the basis of species richness and endemism, but phylogenetic information should also be taken into account. In this study, we calculated several taxonomic and phylogenetic metrics at a high resolution for the endemic flora of the Balearic Islands (154 taxa), in order to identify (i) the spatial patterns and environmental factors that explain this endemism, (ii) hotspots of species and phylogenetic endemism, and (iii) gaps in the protected areas. The taxonomic and phylogenetic metrics showed different distribution patterns, but the mountainous areas of Mallorca, and some coastal areas of the Balearic Islands, have the highest values. These values were positively related to elevation, precipitation, temperature, and slope, and negatively related to the distance from the coast, aspect, and the temperature of the wettest quarter. We identified top grid hotspots where all the metrics had the highest values, and we also identified nano-hotspots within these hotspots, in some of the highest peaks of Mallorca, where most of these metrics&rsquo; maximum values coincided. This approach allowed us to identify some gaps in the conservation priority areas, and to highlight the need to review their boundaries and definition.},

	abstract = {Protected Areas (PAs) are a critical tool for maintaining habitat integrity and species diversity, and now cover more than 12.7 {\%} of the planet's land surface area. However, there is considerable debate on the extent to which PAs deliver conservation outcomes in terms of habitat and species protection. A systematic review approach is applied to investigate the evidence from peer reviewed and grey literature on the effectiveness of PAs focusing on two outcomes: (a) habitat cover and (b) species populations. We only include studies that causally link conservation inputs to outcomes against appropriate counterfactuals. From 2599 publications we found 76 studies from 51 papers that evaluated impacts on habitat cover, and 42 studies from 35 papers on species populations. Three conclusions emerged: first, there is good evidence that PAs have conserved forest habitat; second, evidence remains inconclusive that PAs have been effective at maintaining species populations, although more positive than negative results are reported in the literature; third, causal connections between management inputs and conservation outcomes in PAs are rarely evaluated in the literature. Overall, available evidence suggests that PAs deliver positive outcomes, but there remains a limited evidence base, and weak understanding of the conditions under which PAs succeed or fail to deliver conservation outcomes.},

The results showed that occurrence and 20{\%} abundance targets gave similar optimal solutions for most of the groups considered. At least one fragment on each of the seven studied islands was required to accomplish any occurrence and abundance target. To achieve 80{\%} of abundance for all species, all fragments were necessary and to guarantee 50{\%} of the overall abundance of endemics, 17 out of 18 native forests were needed. A suggestion is made to apply a measure of biotic integrity related to disturbance to select, among alternative optimal solutions, the set of areas that will help to guarantee the viability of populations.

@article{frishkoff2019elevation,
	abstract = {Human impacts, especially land-use change, are precipitating biodiversity loss. Yet anthropogenic drivers are layered atop natural biogeographic gradients. We ask whether the effects of anthropogenic habitat conversion depend on climatic context. We studied the structure of Anolis lizard communities in intact and human-modified habitats across natural climate gradients in the northern Dominican Republic. Using community-wide mark--resight methods to control for detection bias, we show that the effects of habitat conversion reverse with elevation (and thus macroclimate temperature). Deforestation reduces abundance and biomass in lowland communities but has no such effect at high elevations. In contrast, forest loss results in no compositional change in the lowlands, but complete community turnover between habitats in the highlands. These contrasting community-level patterns emerge from consistent responses of individual species based on their thermal niches. Community reorganization in the highlands stems from thermal niche tracking and habitat switching by abundant lowland species. We find no support for the hypothesis that climate generalists outperform specialists to succeed in anthropogenic habitats. Instead, warm-climate specialists dominate anthropogenic habitats, even in cool macroclimates. Human impacts interact with pre-existing environmental gradients to reorganize biodiversity. Leveraging a biogeographic perspective will provide insight into the future communities of life on Earth.},

	abstract = {Despite islands contributing only 6.7{\%} of land surface area, they harbor ~20{\%} of the Earth's biodiversity, but unfortunately also ~50{\%} of the threatened species and 75{\%} of the known extinctions since the European expansion around the globe. Due to their geological and geographic history and characteristics, islands act simultaneously as cradles of evolutionary diversity and museums of formerly widespread lineages---elements that permit islands to achieve an outstanding endemicity. Nevertheless, the majority of these endemic species are inherently vulnerable due to genetic and demographic factors linked with the way islands are colonized. Here, we stress the great variation of islands in their physical geography (area, isolation, altitude, latitude) and history (age, human colonization, human density). We provide examples of some of the most species rich and iconic insular radiations. Next, we analyze the natural vulnerability of the insular biota, linked to genetic and demographic factors as a result of founder events as well as the typically small population sizes of many island species. We note that, whereas evolution toward island syndromes (including size shifts, derived insular woodiness, altered dispersal ability, loss of defense traits, reduction in clutch size) might have improved the ability of species to thrive under natural conditions on islands, it has simultaneously made island biota disproportionately vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, and climate change. This has led to the documented extinction of at least 800 insular species in the past 500 years, in addition to the many that had already gone extinct following the arrival of first human colonists on islands in prehistoric times. Finally, we summarize current scientific knowledge on the ongoing biodiversity loss on islands worldwide and express our serious concern that the current trajectory will continue to decimate the unique and irreplaceable natural heritage of the world's islands. We conclude that drastic actions are urgently needed to bend the curve of the alarming rates of island biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  1. We used a hyperdiverse invertebrate group, tenebrionid beetles, to test competing hypotheses about the factors correlated with the spatial variation in species richness and composition across Europe. 2. We considered the following hypotheses for explaining variation in species richness, (i) spatial heterogeneity, (ii) environmental energy, and (iii) dispersal limitation and post-glacial recolonisation, and the following hypotheses for variation in species composition, (i) current climate, (ii) Pleistocene glaciations, and (iii) neutral dynamics. 3. We used inventories of 36 European territories, built from a database containing the distributions of 1010 species or subspecies. Area, spatial position, and topographical and climatic variables were used as predictors in regression (richness) and constrained analysis of principal coordinates (composition) analyses. 4. The latitudinal richness gradient found in European tenebrionids was mostly explained by the joint effect of environmental and spatial variables, supporting the climate and incomplete recolonisation hypotheses. 5. A parabolic relationship of endemism with longitude points to the presence of centres of endemism in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans. Current climatic conditions alone were not sufficient to explain spatial turnover patterns of European tenebrionids, which are largely influenced by spatial factors. 6. Both the Pleistocene glaciations and neutral hypotheses were supported, but the fact that turnover is not uniform across Europe suggests that the historical effects of Pleistocene glaciations had a deeper impact on tenebrionid assemblages than neutral dynamics. Thus, variation in species richness seems more directly controlled by climatic factors, whereas geographical constraints related to dispersal limitation or stochastic colonisation events influenced species composition.},

One of the most frequently used systems for selecting priority areas is the Key Biodiversity Areas (hereafter KBAs), developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, KBAs cannot be used to rank areas, potentially limiting their use when limited funding is available. To tackle this shortcoming and facilitate spatial prioritization, here we develop and validate the ?WEGE index? (Weighted Endemism including Global Endangerment index), consisting of an adaptation of the EDGE score (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered). WEGE allows the ranking of any set of locations according to the KBA guidelines and on a continuous scale. Location Global. Methods We calculated the EDGE score, Weighted Endemism, Evolutionary distinctiveness, Extinction risk and our newly developed WEGE index for all terrestrial species of amphibians, mammals and birds accessed by IUCN. We then compared the performance of each of those five indices at prioritizing areas according to the KBA guidelines. Results We found that for all taxa surveyed, WEGE was consistently better at identifying areas that trigger KBA status. Main conclusions In our analyses, WEGE outperformed all other methods and metrics designed for similar purposes. It can serve as a robust evidence-based methodology to prioritize among otherwise equally qualified sites according to the KBA categories. WEGE can therefore support transparent, evidence-based and biologically meaningful decision-making for conservation priorities.},

	abstract = {Eight percent of all land surface has been designated as ``Key Biodiversity Areas'' (KBAs). Since these areas were established based on two percent of all terrestrial species estimated to exist, we ask what would happen if we used all species on Earth to identify additional KBAs. We explore this question at a global scale by using data from 64,110 species of animals and plants to identify how many areas could qualify as KBAs under current criteria. We find that between 26{\%} and 68{\%} of the world's terrestrial areas can be classified as KBAs, depending on the spatial resolution. The total area from potential KBAs increases drastically as more species are assessed, suggesting that if all species were included, all land surface could eventually meet the biological requirements for becoming a KBA. KBAs are intended to be areas that are both of biological importance and manageable, but since they lack a data-driven ranking system, the current framework largely sidesteps the biological component. We, therefore, make an urgent call for stricter criteria in the KBA methodology or alternative methodologies that allow for biologically robust area prioritization, help secure evidence-based investments, and support progress toward the targets under the new Global Biodiversity Framework.},

From the start (Systematics Agenda 2000, 1994), the term `taxonomic impediment' has been ambiguous, designating both the insufficiency and inadequacy of the resources put to the service of taxonomy (the taxonomic impediment sensu stricto) and its main consequence, the wide discrepancy between the reality of specific biodiversity and our knowledge of it (the taxonomic gap; Dubois, 2010; Raposo et al., 2020). The total number of species on our planet is unknown, and its various estimates (using different methods) are widely divergent, but consensus exists that we are far from having inventoried half, and most likely one-tenth, of the species still present on earth today (Gonz{\'a}lez-Oreja, 2008).}},

Location  The island of Crete is used as a case study because it is considered to be one of the 10 hotspots for biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin. Methods  Hotspot analysis and complementarity algorithms are used to define priority areas for conservation and calculate their spatial overlap with the Natura 2000 SACs in Crete. Results  The various categories of hotspots contain subsamples of plant categories, used for their definition. Spatial overlap among different categories of hotspots, areas of complementary diversity and Natura 2000 SCAs is low. Main conclusions  The results show that the Natura 2000 SACs `network' in Crete seems insufficient to ensure satisfactory representation of the regional plant biodiversity elements.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation has faced many challenges, especially the conversion of natural areas that compete with use for agriculture, energy production and mineral extraction. This problem is further aggravated by lack of knowledge of the biodiversity that exists and the geographical distribution of different groups. The objectives of our study were to examine the distributional pattern of Gerromorpha diversity in Brazil, create a map of conservation priority areas, estimate the degree of protection that the current network of protected areas guarantees to this insect group, and identify the size thresholds in geographical distributions that would allow species to be protected. We used species occurrences from the Water Bugs Distributional Database, and we used 19 bioclimatic variables to build models of the potential distributions of species using the MaxEnt program. Using the potential model results, we calculated diversity metrics and overlapped them with the current state and federal ``conservation units''(protected areas for biodiversity) in Brazil. Total beta diversity and turnover portions were separated into two faunistic groups, one in northern and the other in southern Brazil. The Amazon has higher beta diversity than what was predicted by the null models. We detected a positive relationship between species distribution area and occurrence in conservation units. Conservation units with less than 250 km2 do not protect Gerromorpha species. Our results reinforce the necessity of formulating new conservation strategies for this group, contemplating species with both restricted and ample distributions, because rare and specialist species are the most harmed by habitat reduction, given that they are more sensitive to environmental disturbance.},

	abstract = {Most existing protected area networks are biased to protect charismatic species or landscapes. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed to include unseen biodiversity---species rich groups that consist of inconspicuous taxa, or groups affected by knowledge gaps---are more efficient than networks that ignore these groups. To test this hypothesis, we generated species distribution models for 3006 arthropod species to determine which were represented in three networks of different sizes and biogeographic origin. We assessed the efficiency of each network using spatial prioritization to measure its completeness, the increment needed to achieve conservation targets, and its specificity, the extent to which proposed priority areas to maximize unseen biodiversity overlap with existing networks. We found that the representativeness of unseen biodiversity in the studied protected areas, or extrinsic representativeness, is low, with \~{} 40{\%} of the analyzed unseen biodiversity species being unprotected. We also found that existing networks should be expanded \~{} 26{\%} to 46{\%} of their current area to complete targets, and that existing networks do not efficiently conserve the unseen biodiversity given their low specificity (as low as 8.8{\%}) unseen biodiversity. We conclude that information on unseen biodiversity must be included in systematic conservation planning approaches to design more efficient and ecologically representative protected areas.},

	n2 = {Abstract Hydrological extremes have negative impacts on natural, agricultural, and urban landscapes and place substantial ecological pressure on freshwater habitats. However, the role of artificial freshwater habitats during hydrological drought is poorly understood. Insects make up much of total aquatic fauna and lend themselves to understanding how drought impacts freshwater ecosystems. Using the Greater Cape Floristic Region as an example of a drought-prone area, we determined the effects of a severe drought on a subset of insects occupying lentic habitats in terms of their species richness, diversity, and assemblage composition. Here, we: (1) calculated the percentage change in average precipitation between a record dry season and the last consistently wet decade; (2) identified the environmental variables driving aquatic insect species richness, diversity and composition; (3) identified the environmental differences between natural ponds and artificial reservoirs; (4) determined whether artificial reservoirs act as suitable habitats for focal taxa during drought; and (5) compared these results to other, pre-drought studies. Environmental variables related to water chemistry and physical characteristics were drivers of species richness, diversity, and composition, yet vegetation cover remained a major driver. In terms of marginal vegetation cover, most artificial reservoirs did not resemble natural ponds, yet overall 38.4{\%} of sampled aquatic insect species were shared between natural ponds and artificial reservoirs. We found some rare endemic species in artificial reservoirs that had never before been recorded in this habitat during wet years. When our drought findings were compared to earlier, wet years, species richness did not change significantly, although abundance was much lower during the drought year. We postulate that historically, these aquatic insects, which have been through many ecological filters such as drought, must have sought low-quality habitats to survive water stress periods. Artificial reservoirs, being novel landscape features, cannot fully replace natural ponds, but enable some aquatic insects to survive drought. Artificial reservoirs can be attractive habitats to aquatic insects when they resemble natural ponds, with specific reference to their marginal vegetation characteristics.},

	n2 = {Abstract The Red List Categories and the accompanying five criteria developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) provide an authoritative and comprehensive methodology to assess the conservation status of organisms. Red List criterion B, which principally uses distribution data, is the most widely used to assess conservation status, particularly of plant species. No software package has previously been available to perform large-scale multispecies calculations of the three main criterion B parameters {$[$}extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO) and an estimate of the number of locations{$]$} and provide preliminary conservation assessments using an automated batch process. We developed ConR, a dedicated R package, as a rapid and efficient tool to conduct large numbers of preliminary assessments, thereby facilitating complete Red List assessment. ConR (1) calculates key geographic range parameters (AOO and EOO) and estimates the number of locations sensu IUCN needed for an assessment under criterion B; (2) uses this information in a batch process to generate preliminary assessments of multiple species; (3) summarize the parameters and preliminary assessments in a spreadsheet; and (4) provides a visualization of the results by generating maps suitable for the submission of full assessments to the IUCN Red List. ConR can be used for any living organism for which reliable georeferenced distribution data are available. As distributional data for taxa become increasingly available via large open access datasets, ConR provides a novel, timely tool to guide and accelerate the work of the conservation and taxonomic communities by enabling practitioners to conduct preliminary assessments simultaneously for hundreds or even thousands of species in an efficient and time-saving way.},

This is also the case for the most important network of protected areas in Europe, the Natura 2000 network. In the current study we evaluated the distribution pattern of alien plant taxa across selected continental and insular Natura 2000 sites in Greece and their potential spread 15 years since first being recorded in the field. A total of seventy-three naturalized plant taxa were recorded in the 159 sites under study. At the site level and regardless of the habitat group, the ratio of invaded areas increased between the two monitoring campaigns. An increase in the ratio of invaded plots was also detected for all habitat groups, except for grassland and riparian---wetland habitats. Precipitation during the dry quarter of the year was the factor that mainly controlled the occurrence and spread of alien plant taxa regardless of the site and habitat group. It is reasonable to say that the characterization of an area as protected may not be sufficient without having implemented the proper practices for halting biological invasions.},

@article{carpaneto2015a-red-list,
	abstractnote = {The main objectives of this review are: 1) the compilation and updating of a reference database for Italian saproxylic beetles, useful to assess the trend of their populations and communities in the next decades; 2) the identification of the major threats involving the known Italian species of saproxylic beetles; 3) the evaluation of the extinction risk for all known Italian species of saproxylic beetles; 4) the or- ganization of an expert network for studying and continuous updating of all known species of saproxylic beetle species in Italy; 5) the creation of a baseline for future evaluations of the trends in biodiversity conservation in Italy; 6) the assignment of ecological categories to all the Italian saproxylic beetles, useful for the aims of future researches on their communities and on forest environments. The assess- ments of extinction risk are based on the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria and the most updated guidelines. The assessments have been carried out by experts covering different regions of Italy, and have been evaluated according to the IUCN standards. All the beetles whose larval biology is sufficiently well known as to be considered saproxylic have been included in the Red List, either the autochtho- nous species (native or possibly native to Italy) or a few allochthonous species recently introduced or probably introduced to Italy in his- toric times. The entire national range of each saproxylic beetle species was evaluated, including large and small islands; for most species, the main parameters considered for evaluation were the extent of their geographical occurrence in Italy, and the number of known sites of presence. 2049 saproxylic beetle species (belonging to 66 families) have been listed, assigned to a trophic category (Table 3) and 97 {\%} of them have been assessed. On the whole, threatened species (VU + EN + CR) are 421 (Fig. 6), corresponding to 21 {\%} of the 1988 as- sessed species; only two species are formally recognized to be probably Regionally Extinct in Italy in recent times. Little less than 65{\%} of the Italian saproxylic beetles are not currently threatened with extinction, although their populations are probably declining. In forest environments, the main threats are habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution due to the use of pesticide against forest pests, and habitat simplification due to economic forest management. In coastal environments, the main threats are due to massive touristic exploitation such as the excess of urbanization and infrastructures along the seashore, and the complete removal of woody materials as tree trunks stranded on the beaches, because this kind of intervention is considered an aesthetic amelioration of seaside resorts. The number of spe- cies whose populations may become impoverished by direct harvest (only a few of large forest beetles frequently collected by insect traders) is very small and almost negligible. The Red List is a fundamental tool for the identification of conservation priorities, but it is not a list of priorities on its own. Other elements instrumental to priority setting include the cost of actions, the probability of success,and the proportion of the global population of each species living in Italy, which determines the national responsibility in the long-term conservation of that species. In this scenario, information on all species endemic to Italy, to Corso-Sardinia, to the Tuscan-Corsican ar- eas, and to the Siculo-Maltese insular system are given. A short analysis on relationships among beetle species traits, taxonomy, special- ist approaches, and IUCN Categories of Risk is also presented.},

	abstract = {Here we build on the manifesto `World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, issued by the Alliance of World Scientists. As a group of conservation biologists deeply concerned about the decline of insect populations, we here review what we know about the drivers of insect extinctions, their consequences, and how extinctions can negatively impact humanity. We are causing insect extinctions by driving habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, use of polluting and harmful substances, the spread of invasive species, global climate change, direct overexploitation, and co-extinction of species dependent on other species. With insect extinctions, we lose much more than species. We lose abundance and biomass of insects, diversity across space and time with consequent homogenization, large parts of the tree of life, unique ecological functions and traits, and fundamental parts of extensive networks of biotic interactions. Such losses lead to the decline of key ecosystem services on which humanity depends. From pollination and decomposition, to being resources for new medicines, habitat quality indication and many others, insects provide essential and irreplaceable services. We appeal for urgent action to close key knowledge gaps and curb insect extinctions. An investment in research programs that generate local, regional and global strategies that counter this trend is essential. Solutions are available and implementable, but urgent action is needed now to match our intentions.},

@article{cardoso2011the-seven,
	abstract = {Despite their high diversity and importance for humankind, invertebrates are often neglected in biodiversity conservation policies. We identify seven impediments to their effective protection: (1) invertebrates and their ecological services are mostly unknown to the general public (the public dilemma); (2) policymakers and stakeholders are mostly unaware of invertebrate conservation problems (the political dilemma); (3) basic science on invertebrates is scarce and underfunded (the scientific dilemma); (4) most species are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (5) the distribution of described species is mostly unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (6) the abundance of species and their changes in space and time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); (7) species ways of life and sensitivities to habitat change are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall). Numerous recent developments in taxonomy, inventorying, monitoring, data compilation, statistical analysis and science communication facilitate overcoming these impediments in both policy and practice. We suggest as possible solutions for the public dilemma: better public information and marketing. For the political dilemma: red-listing, legal priority listing and inclusion in environmental impact assessment studies. For the scientific dilemma: parataxonomy, citizen science programs and biodiversity informatics. For the Linnean shortfall: biodiversity surrogacy, increased support for taxonomy and advances in taxonomic publications. For the Wallacean shortfall: funding of inventories, compilation of data in public repositories and species distribution modeling. For the Prestonian shortfall: standardized protocols for inventorying and monitoring, widespread use of analogous protocols and increased support for natural history collections. For the Hutchinsonian shortfall: identifying good indicator taxa and studying extinction rates by indirect evidence.},

@article{cardoso2011adapting,
	abstract = {The IUCN Red List is the most useful list of species that are at risk for extinction worldwide, as it relies on a number of objective criteria. Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet's biota, particularly local endemics. By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of invertebrates. By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally, co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the classification process. As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter (27{\%}) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically Endangered, 19{\%} as Endangered, 6{\%} as Vulnerable and 8{\%} as Least Concern.

	abstract = {Abstract The last 3 years have seen a global outbreak of media headlines predicting a global insect apocalypse and a subsequent collapse of natural ecosystems, a so-called `ecological armageddon' resulting in the demise of human civilisation as we know it. Despite the worrying implications of these papers, all studies on global insect extinction to date clearly reflect the Prestonian shortfall, the general lack of knowledge on the abundance of species and their trends in space and time. Data currently available concerning global insect abundance trends invariably suffer from phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal bias. Here, we suggest that to follow the real global changes in insect (and all other taxa) communities, biases or shortcomings in data collection must be avoided. An optimised scheme would maximise phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal coverage with minimum investment. Standardised sampling would provide primary data, on a first step in the form of abundance and biomass. Individuals would then be identified to species level whenever possible, with a morphospecies approach or genetics serving as intermediate steps, complementing or even final steps for non-described species. If standardised abundance and ecological data can be readily made available, biodiversity trends can be tracked in real time and allow us to predict and prevent an impending global insect apocalypse.},

Species of selected taxa (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Odonata and Orthoptera), from Northern or Central Europe, relatively widespread, of a large body size and attractive are favoured over species of other taxa, from southern and Mediterranean Europe, endemic or relatively small or inconspicuous. Such biases are obstacles to the effective protection of the European fauna. 3. Two main strategies should be followed to avoid these problems and therefore increase the effectiveness of conservation policies: (i) the adoption of objective and transparent criteria for the listing of protected species, and (ii) implement regular updates and amendments to the lists based on such criteria.},

@article{branco2020an-expert-based,
	abstract = {Despite the prominent role of spiders in most ecosystems, these invertebrates are still notably endangered as well as underrepresented in current conservation efforts. We sent a survey to spider experts and enthusiasts belonging to arachnological societies across the globe to determine the general consensus on globally relevant threats to spiders as well as the most relevant conservation measures. We report that respondents found agriculture, livestock farming & forestry, climate change, urbanisation and pollution (including pesticides) to be the most relevant threats to spider species worldwide. Likewise, land protection and education & awareness were considered the most relevant conservation measures to avoid species declines and extinctions. Although these results tend to be consistent across the biogeographic regions of expertise of respondents, there was significant variation between regions. We discuss the support and justification for the patterns found, their regional variations, and the relevance of threats and conservation measures. This is the first global roadmap for spider species conservation action and research. In general, land should be set aside for species protection, agroforestry practices should be carefully considered, climate change should be mitigated, and the general public should be made more aware of spiders, their importance and the threats they face.},

@article{borges2005ranking,
	abstract = {Nineteen areas in seven of the nine Azorean islands were evaluated for species diversity and rarity based on soil epigean arthropods. Fifteen out of the 19 study areas are managed as Natural Forest Reserves and the remaining four were included due to their importance as indigenous forest cover. Four of the 19 areas are not included in the European Conservation network, NATURA 2000. Two sampling replicates were run per study area, and a total of 191 species were collected; 43 of those species (23{\%}) are endemic to the archipelago and 12 have yet to be described. To produce an unbiased multiple-criteria index (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating diversity and rarity based indices, an iterative partial multiple regression analysis was performed. In addition, an irreplaceability index and the complementarity method (using both optimisation and heuristic methods) were used for priority-reserves analyses. It was concluded that at least one well-managed reserve per island is absolutely necessary to have a good fraction of the endemic arthropods preserved. We found that for presence/absence data the suboptimal complementarity algorithm provides solutions as good as the optimal algorithm. For abundance data, optimal solutions indicate that most reserves are needed if we want that at least 50{\%} of endemic arthropod populations are represented in a minimum set of reserves. Consistently, two of the four areas not included in the NATURA 2000 framework were considered of high priority, indicating that vascular plants and bird species used to determine NATURA 2000 sites are not good surrogates of arthropod diversity in the Azores. The most irreplaceable reserves are those located in older islands, which indicates that geological history plays an important role in explaining faunal diversity of arthropods in the Azores. Based both on the uniqueness of species composition and high species richness, conservation efforts should be focused on the unmanaged Pico Alto region in the archipelago's oldest island, Santa Maria.},

These were mostly dedicated to projects aimed at providing services to taxonomy via information and technology, or to develop ``modern'', i.e., molecular, approaches to taxonomy. Traditional taxonomy was overly neglected and is in serious distress all over the world. It is argued that both novel and traditional ways to study biodiversity are essential and that the demise of traditional taxonomy (based on phenotypes) in the era of biodiversity is the result of an unwise policy, mainly fostered by portions of the scientific community that aim at taking total advantage of the funds dedicated to the study of biodiversity.},

@article{barahona-segovia2021an-overview,
	abstract = {Neotropical efforts for arthropod conservation are still insufficient. Some species from the Neotropical region have been assessed by the IUCN Red List criteria (IRL), while others have been assessed using local red lists (LRLs). Unfortunately, these two lists are completely unconnected, even when they use similar criteria to evaluate extinction risks. Therefore, an overview of arthropod conservation using the IRL and LRLs to determine general and common patterns for arthropods in the Neotropical region is still missing, and this was the main goal of our study. The LRLs provided significant information about the species under threat in the Neotropical region, particularly on endemic ones. Both the IRL and LRLs determined that habitat loss (agricultural use land than more 50{\%}) is the most critical threat of arthropod diversity in this region, but other main threats were also found. The conservation efforts for arthropods in Neotropical countries have been developed heterogeneously. Special efforts are necessary to countries without red lists as large countries, islands, or island-like bioregions. So far, the most threatened arthropod diversity in the Neotropical region belongs to the Caribbean islands. Insect conservation is not just about red-listing. It is also crucial to conduct conservation action as habitat management and restoration, citizen science or specific policy to fight the illegal trade. The integration of LRLs with the IRL helped identify common threats to arthropod conservation and also facilitated the macroscopic evaluation of this topic. It is crucial to conserve Neotropical arthropods to protect animal biodiversity.},

@article{Assing_2019,
	abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mit ihrer durch lange Isolation sowie durch Zeiten teilweiser Fragmentierung, Submersion und nachfolgender Hebung gekennzeichneten geologischen Vergangenheit, ihrer bemerkenswerten topologischen, geologischen und {\"o}kologischen Diversit{\"a}t und ihrer Gr{\"o}{\ss}e bot die griechische Insel Kreta ideale Voraussetzungen f{\"u}r Speziationsprozesse und die Entwicklung einer einzigartigen und reichhaltigen Staphylinidenfauna. Die Erforschung dieser Fauna begann zwar bereits in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts, ihre gezielte und systematische Erfassung erfolgte jedoch erst in den vergangenen sieben Jahren. Auf der Grundlage einer kritischen Auswertung von Literaturmeldungen, der Ergebnisse mehrerer Forschungsreisen und weiterer bislang unver{\"o}ffentlichter Nachweise wird eine Checkliste der Staphyliniden erstellt. Insgesamt 397 benannte Arten sind derzeit von Kreta bekannt, von denen 115 erstmals von der Insel nachgewiesen werden; insgesamt 48 Arten, davon 47 endemisch, werden im zweiten Teil der Monografie neu beschrieben. Weitere unidentifizierte und unbenannte Arten sowie irrt{\"u}mlich oder zweifelhaft von Kreta gemeldete Arten werden separat aufgelistet. Die systematische, zoogeographische und {\"o}kologische Zusammensetzung der Staphylinidenfauna Kretas wird charakterisiert. Einen Schwerpunkt bilden dabei die Endemiten, die mit 111 benannten und mindestens zehn unbenannten Arten vertreten sind, insgesamt fast ein Drittel der Gesamtdiversit{\"a}t ausmachen und vor allem zu den Unterfamilien Aleocharinae, Scydmaeninae, Pselaphinae, Paederinae, Leptotyphlinae, Staphylininae und Omaliinae geh{\"o}ren. Mehr als die H{\"a}lfte dieser Arten ist auf Kreta lokalendemisch. Die Gattungen mit den meisten Endemiten sind &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Cephennium&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; M{\"u}ller &amp;amp;amp; Kunze, 1822 der Scydmaeninae (zw{\"o}lf benannte Arten) and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Geostiba&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Thomson, 1858 der Aleocharinae (neun Arten). Bei {\"u}ber zwei Dritteln der Endemiten handelt es sich um epig{\"a}ische Bewohner von Wald-, Busch-, Strauch-, Gras- und Feuchtbiotopen. Etwa ein Viertel lebt in tieferen Bodenschichten oder ist endog{\"a}isch und 8 {\%} sind mit Ameisen assoziiert. Etwas mehr als die H{\"a}lfte der Endemiten (59 Arten; 53 {\%}) bilden nach derzeitigem Kenntnisstand 18 monophyletische Gruppen und sind damit offenbar das Ergebnis von Radiationsprozessen auf der Insel, w{\"a}hrend sich die {\"u}brigen Arten durch Vikarianz mit Arten des Festlands herausgebildet haben. Ein Vergleich mit anderen Mittelmeerinseln ergab, dass (a) die Gesamtdiversit{\"a}t der Fauna Kretas die anderer Inseln der {\"o}stlichen Mittelmeerraums au{\ss}er Korfu klar {\"u}bertrifft, andererseits aber deutlich geringer ist als die Korsikas, Sardiniens und Siziliens, (b) Kreta hinsichtlich der Diversit{\"a}t endemischer Arten nur von Korsika und Sardinien {\"u}bertroffen wird, und dass (c) der Anteil der Endemiten an der Gesamtdiversit{\"a}t auf Kreta h{\"o}her ist als auf allen anderen Mittelmeerinseln. Erkl{\"a}rungen f{\"u}r die beobachteten Unterschiede in der Zusammensetzung und Diversit{\"a}t der Inseln werden diskutiert. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Stichoglossa graeca&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Bernhauer, 1905, von der zuvor nur der Lectotypus bekannt war, wird beschrieben und abgebildet.

@article{armijo1992east-west,
	abstract = {Examination of surface fault traces with Spot images and in the field corroborates the inference that the active tectonics of southern Peloponnesus and Crete are dominated by approximately north-south normal faulting and approximately east-west extension. The heights of Holocene normal-fault scarps yield first-order regional estimates of fault slip rates between 0.1 and 2-3 mm/yr. Most of the surface scarps probably ruptured during past earthquakes, such as that which destroyed Sparta in 464 B.C. On the Sparta fault the Holocene average slip rate and the recurrence time of large earthquakes may be ∼1 mm/yr and 3000 yr, respectively. The regional pattern of Quaternary faulting suggests that the east-west extension near the Hellenic subduction zone is fast (about 5{\%}-10{\%}/m.y.). The change from north-south to east-west extension in the late Pliocene (∼2-4 Ma) implies that the Aegean is starting to collide with the northern margin of Africa.},

@article{antonelli2018geological,
	abstract = {Mountains are key features of the Earth's surface and host a substantial proportion of the world's species. However, the links between the evolution and distribution of biodiversity and the formation of mountains remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate multiple datasets to assess the relationships between species richness in mountains, geology and climate at global and regional scales. Specifically, we analyse how erosion, relief, soil and climate relate to the geographical distribution of terrestrial tetrapods, which include amphibians, birds and mammals. We find that centres of species richness correlate with areas of high temperatures, annual rainfall and topographic relief, supporting previous studies. We unveil additional links between mountain-building processes and biodiversity: species richness correlates with erosion rates and heterogeneity of soil types, with a varying response across continents. These additional links are prominent but under-explored, and probably relate to the interplay between surface uplift, climate change and atmospheric circulation through time. They are also influenced by the location and orientation of mountain ranges in relation to air circulation patterns, and how species diversification, dispersal and refugia respond to climate change. A better understanding of biosphere--lithosphere interactions is needed to understand the patterns and evolution of mountain biodiversity across space and time.},

	abstract = {Habitats are known to vary in their vulnerability to invasion by alien plants and different species often colonise distinct habitats. To assess the consistency in the degree of invasion of particular habitats, this study examined the frequency of occurrence and local abundance of three invasive plant taxa: Ailanthus altissima, Carpobrotus spp., and Oxalis pes-caprae across different habitat types on four representative Mediterranean islands. We conducted systematic field surveys recording the presence-absence and cover of these taxa on the islands of Mallorca, Corsica, Sardinia and Crete. Drawing on the results of 5,285 sample points, the frequency of occurrence of the three invaders tends to be higher than expected in urban, ruderal and roadside habitats. In contrast, scrub habitats rarely contain any of the three invaders, indicating that they may be more resistant to invasion. The degree of invasion, determined by the local abundance of an invasive plant in any one habitat, varies according to the identity of the invader and the island. However, based on average abundance, Oxalis pes-caprae exhibits the highest degree of invasion, and Carpobrotus spp. the least. There is no indication that any one of the four islands is more prone to either higher frequencies or abundances of the three invaders. These patterns suggest that anthropogenic changes in Mediterranean islands will increase the vulnerability of certain habitats to invasion and increase the distribution of these three invasive taxa at any of the four islands.},

@article{andreone2022reconnecting,
	abstract = {In Italy, differently from other countries, a national museum of natural history is not present. This absence is due, among other reasons, to its historical political fragmentation up to 1870, which led to the establishment of medium-sized museums, mostly managed by local administrations or universities. Moreover, a change of paradigm in biological research, at the beginning of the 20th century, contributed to privilege experimental studies in universities and facilitated the dismissal of descriptive and exploratory biology, which formed the basis of the taxonomic research carried out by natural history museums. Consequently, only a few museums have a provision of curatorial staff, space and material resources adequate to maintain their original mission of discovering the natural world, by conducting a regular research activity accompanied by field campaigns. The creation of a national research centre for the study of biodiversity, facilitating interconnections among the existing natural history museums could be a solution and is here supported, together with a centralised biorepository to host collections and vouchers, to the benefit of current and future taxonomic research and environmental conservation. Such an institution should find place and realisation within the recently proposed National Biodiversity Future Center (NBFC) planned within the National Plan of Recovery and Resilience (PNRR). Pending upon the creation of this new national centre, a network among the existing museums should coordinate their activities.},

ABSTRACT={Studies in microbiology have long been mostly restricted to small spatial scales. However, recent technological advances, such as new sequencing methodologies, have ushered an era of large-scale sequencing of environmental DNA data from multiple biomes worldwide. These global datasets can now be used to explore long standing questions of microbial ecology. New methodological approaches and concepts are being developed to study such large-scale patterns in microbial communities, resulting in new perspectives that represent a significant advances for both microbiology and macroecology. Here, we identify and review important conceptual, computational, and methodological challenges and opportunities in microbial macroecology. Specifically, we discuss the challenges of handling and analyzing large amounts of microbiome data to understand taxa distribution and co-occurrence patterns. We also discuss approaches for modeling microbial communities based on environmental data, including information on biological interactions to make full use of available Big Data. Finally, we summarize the methods presented in a general approach aimed to aid microbiologists in addressing fundamental questions in microbial macroecology, including classical propositions (such as “everything is everywhere, but the environment selects”) as well as applied ecological problems, such as those posed by human induced global environmental changes.}

    abstract = { Microbiomes are complex and ubiquitous networks of microorganisms whose seemingly limitless chemical transformations could be harnessed to benefit agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. The spatial and temporal changes in microbiome composition and function are influenced by a multitude of molecular and ecological factors. This complexity yields both versatility and challenges in designing synthetic microbiomes and perturbing natural microbiomes in controlled, predictable ways. In this review, we describe factors that give rise to emergent spatial and temporal microbiome properties and the meta-omics and computational modeling tools that can be used to understand microbiomes at the cellular and system levels. We also describe strategies for designing and engineering microbiomes to enhance or build novel functions. Throughout the review, we discuss key knowledge and technology gaps for elucidating the networks and deciphering key control points for microbiome engineering, and highlight examples where multiple omics and modeling approaches can be integrated to address these gaps. }

ABSTRACT={Datasets collected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 16S rRNA gene amplimers, metagenomes or metatranscriptomes are commonplace and being used to study human disease states, ecological differences between sites, and the built environment. There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.}

However, this sensitivity is a double-edged sword because these tools also efficiently detect contaminant DNA and cross-contamination, which can confound the interpretation of microbiome data. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate key controls into microbiome research to improve the integrity of microbiome studies. Here, we review how contaminant DNA and cross-contamination arise within microbiome studies and discuss their negative impacts, especially during the analysis of low microbial biomass samples. We then identify several key measures that researchers can implement to reduce the impact of contaminant DNA and cross-contamination during microbiome research. We put forward a set of minimal experimental criteria, the ‘RIDE’ checklist, to improve the validity of future low microbial biomass research.}

abstract={Recent advances have made it possible to analyze high-throughput marker-gene sequencing data without resorting to the customary construction of molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs): clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity threshold. New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs---including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction---and of de novo OTUs---including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

ABSTRACT={With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, it has become convenient and cost efficient to thoroughly characterize the microbial diversity and taxonomic composition in various environmental samples. Millions of sequencing data can be generated, and how to utilize this enormous sequence resource has become a critical concern for microbial ecologists. One particular challenge is the OTUs (operational taxonomic units) picking in 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Lucky, this challenge can be directly addressed by sequence clustering that attempts to group similar sequences. Therefore, numerous clustering methods have been proposed to help to cluster 16S rRNA sequences into OTUs. However, each method has its clustering mechanism, and different methods produce diverse outputs. Even a slight parameter change for the same method can also generate distinct results, and how to choose an appropriate method has become a challenge for inexperienced users. A lot of time and resources can be wasted in selecting clustering tools and analyzing the clustering results. In this study, we introduced the recent advance of clustering methods for OTUs picking, which mainly focus on three aspects: (i) the principles of existing clustering algorithms, (ii) benchmark dataset construction for OTU picking and evaluation metrics, and (iii) the performance of different methods with various distance thresholds on benchmark datasets. This paper aims to assist biological researchers to select the reasonable clustering methods for analyzing their collected sequences and help algorithm developers to design more efficient sequences clustering methods.}

). Sequence clustering is a common early step in amplicon-based microbial community analysis, when raw sequencing reads are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to reduce the run time of subsequent analysis steps. Here, we evaluated the performance of recently released state-of-the-art open-source clustering software products, namely, OTUCLUST, Swarm, SUMACLUST, and SortMeRNA, against current principal options (UCLUST and USEARCH) in QIIME, hierarchical clustering methods in mothur, and USEARCH’s most recent clustering algorithm, UPARSE. All the latest open-source tools showed promising results, reporting up to 60\% fewer spurious OTUs than UCLUST, indicating that the underlying clustering algorithm can vastly reduce the number of these derived OTUs. Furthermore, we observed that stringent quality filtering, such as is done in UPARSE, can cause a significant underestimation of species abundance and diversity, leading to incorrect biological results. Swarm, SUMACLUST, and SortMeRNA have been included in the QIIME 1.9.0 release.

    abstract = { Microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our understanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing technologies. These advances have wide-ranging implications for fields ranging from agriculture to human health. Due to limitations in databases, the majority of microbial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on DNA sequence similarity. There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches. Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97\% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all α and β diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r \&gt; 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) α and β diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs.

Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches. }

    abstract = {Advances in the analysis of amplicon sequence datasets have introduced a methodological shift in how research teams investigate microbial biodiversity, away from sequence identity-based clustering (producing Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) to denoising methods (producing amplicon sequence variants, ASVs). While denoising methods have several inherent properties that make them desirable compared to clustering-based methods, questions remain as to the influence that these pipelines have on the ecological patterns being assessed, especially when compared to other methodological choices made when processing data (e.g. rarefaction) and computing diversity indices. We compared the respective influences of two widely used methods, namely DADA2 (a denoising method) vs. Mothur (a clustering method) on 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets (hypervariable region v4), and compared such effects to the rarefaction of the community table and OTU identity threshold (97{\%} vs. 99{\%}) on the ecological signals detected. We used a dataset comprising freshwater invertebrate (three Unionidae species) gut and environmental (sediment, seston) communities sampled in six rivers in the southeastern USA. We ranked the respective effects of each methodological choice on alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic composition. The choice of the pipeline significantly influenced alpha and beta diversities and changed the ecological signal detected, especially on presence/absence indices such as the richness index and unweighted Unifrac. Interestingly, the discrepancy between OTU and ASV-based diversity metrics could be attenuated by the use of rarefaction. The identification of major classes and genera also revealed significant discrepancies across pipelines. Compared to the pipeline’s effect, OTU threshold and rarefaction had a minimal impact on all measurements.},

    abstract = { 16S rRNA gene sequencing has engendered significant interest in studying microbial communities. There has been tension between trying to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to increasingly lower taxonomic levels and the reality that those levels were defined using more sequence and physiological information than is available from a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) have been proposed as an alternative to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for analyzing microbial communities. ASVs have grown in popularity, in part because of a desire to reflect a more refined level of taxonomy since they do not cluster sequences based on a distance-based threshold. However, ASVs and the use of overly narrow thresholds to identify OTUs increase the risk of splitting a single genome into separate clusters. To assess this risk, I analyzed the intragenomic variation of 16S rRNA genes from the bacterial genomes represented in an rrn copy number database, which contained 20,427 genomes from 5,972 species. As the number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene increased in a genome, the number of ASVs also increased. There was an average of 0.58 ASVs per copy of the 16S rRNA gene for full-length 16S rRNA genes. It was necessary to use a distance threshold of 5.25\% to cluster full-length ASVs from the same genome into a single OTU with 95\% confidence for genomes with 7 copies of the 16S rRNA, such as Escherichia coli. This research highlights the risk of splitting a single bacterial genome into separate clusters when ASVs are used to analyze 16S rRNA gene sequence data. Although there is also a risk of clustering ASVs from different species into the same OTU when using broad distance thresholds, these risks are of less concern than artificially splitting a genome into separate ASVs and OTUs. IMPORTANCE 16S rRNA gene sequencing has engendered significant interest in studying microbial communities. There has been tension between trying to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to increasingly lower taxonomic levels and the reality that those levels were defined using more sequence and physiological information than is available from a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, the naming of bacterial taxa reflects the biases of those who name them. One motivation for the recent push to adopt ASVs in place of OTUs in microbial community analyses is to allow researchers to perform their analyses at the finest possible level that reflects species-level taxonomy. The current research is significant because it quantifies the risk of artificially splitting bacterial genomes into separate clusters. Far from providing a better representation of bacterial taxonomy and biology, the ASV approach can lead to conflicting inferences about the ecology of different ASVs from the same genome. }

abstract = {Abstract Despite decades of research on the interactions between ecology and evolution, opportunities still remain to further integrate the two disciplines, especially when considering multispecies systems. Here, we discuss two such opportunities. First, the traditional emphasis on the distinction between evolutionary and ecological processes should be further relaxed as it is particularly unhelpful in the study of microbial communities, where the very notion of species is hard to define. Second, key processes of evolutionary theory such as adaptation should be exported to hierarchical levels higher than populations to make sense of biodiversity dynamics. Together, we argue that broadening our perspective of eco-evolutionary dynamics to be more inclusive of all biodiversity, both phylogenetically and hierarchically, will open up fertile new research directions and help us to address one of the major scientific challenges of our time, that is, to understand and predict changes in biodiversity in the face of rapid environmental change.}

abstract = {Abstract Microorganisms are the primary engines of biogeochemical processes and foundational to the provisioning of ecosystem services to human society. Free-living microbial communities (microbiomes) and their functioning are now known to be highly sensitive to environmental change. Given microorganisms' capacity for rapid evolution, evolutionary processes could play a role in this response. Currently, however, few models of biogeochemical processes explicitly consider how microbial evolution will affect biogeochemical responses to environmental change. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for explicitly integrating evolution into microbiome–functioning relationships. We consider how microbiomes respond simultaneously to environmental change via four interrelated processes that affect overall microbiome functioning (physiological acclimation, demography, dispersal and evolution). Recent evidence in both the laboratory and the field suggests that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur simultaneously within microbiomes; however, the implications for biogeochemistry under environmental change will depend on the timescales over which these processes contribute to a microbiome's response. Over the long term, evolution may play an increasingly important role for microbially driven biogeochemical responses to environmental change, particularly to conditions without recent historical precedent.}

abstract = {Abstract Aim Addressing global environmental challenges requires access to biodiversity data across wide spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. Availability of such data has increased exponentially recently with the proliferation of biodiversity databases. However, heterogeneous coverage, protocols, and standards have hampered integration among these databases. To stimulate the next stage of data integration, here we present a synthesis of major databases, and investigate (a) how the coverage of databases varies across taxonomy, space, and record type; (b) what degree of integration is present among databases; (c) how integration of databases can increase biodiversity knowledge; and (d) the barriers to database integration. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Plants and vertebrates. Methods We reviewed 12 established biodiversity databases that mainly focus on geographic distributions and functional traits at global scale. We synthesized information from these databases to assess the status of their integration and major knowledge gaps and barriers to full integration. We estimated how improved integration can increase the data coverage for terrestrial plants and vertebrates. Results Every database reviewed had a unique focus of data coverage. Exchanges of biodiversity information were common among databases, although not always clearly documented. Functional trait databases were more isolated than those pertaining to species distributions. Variation and potential incompatibility of taxonomic systems used by different databases posed a major barrier to data integration. We found that integration of distribution databases could lead to increased taxonomic coverage that corresponds to 23 years’ advancement in data accumulation, and improvement in taxonomic coverage could be as high as 22.4\% for trait databases. Main conclusions Rapid increases in biodiversity knowledge can be achieved through the integration of databases, providing the data necessary to address critical environmental challenges. Full integration across databases will require tackling the major impediments to data integration: taxonomic incompatibility, lags in data exchange, barriers to effective data synchronization, and isolation of individual initiatives.},

abstract = {Abstract Forests are ecosystems critical to understanding the global carbon budget, due to their carbon sequestration potential in both aboveground and belowground compartments, especially in species-rich forests. Soil carbon sequestration is strongly linked to soil microbial communities, and this link is mediated by the tree community, likely due to modifications of microenvironmental conditions (i.e., biotic conditions, soil properties, and microclimate). We studied soil carbon concentration and the soil microbial biomass of 180 local neighborhoods along a gradient of tree species richness ranging from 1 to 16 tree species per plot in a Chinese subtropical forest experiment (BEF-China). Tree productivity and different tree functional traits were measured at the neighborhood level. We tested the effects of tree productivity, functional trait identity, and dissimilarity on soil carbon concentrations, and their mediation by the soil microbial biomass and microenvironmental conditions. Our analyses showed a strong positive correlation between soil microbial biomass and soil carbon concentrations. In addition, soil carbon concentration increased with tree productivity and tree root diameter, while it decreased with litterfall C:N content. Moreover, tree productivity and tree functional traits (e.g., fungal root association and litterfall C:N ratio) modulated microenvironmental conditions with substantial consequences for soil microbial biomass. We also showed that soil history and topography should be considered in future experiments and tree plantations, as soil carbon concentrations were higher at sites where historical (i.e., at the beginning of the experiment) carbon concentrations were high, themselves being strongly affected by the topography. Altogether, these results implied that the quantification of the different soil carbon pools is critical for understanding microbial community–soil carbon stock relationships and their dependence on tree diversity and microenvironmental conditions.}

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which large-scale microbial community function emerges from complex ecological interactions between individual taxa and functional groups remain obscure. We leveraged network analyses of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences obtained over a seven-month timeseries in seasonally anoxic Saanich Inlet (Vancouver Island, Canada) to investigate relationships between microbial community structure and water column N2O cycling. Taxa separately broadly into three discrete subnetworks with contrasting environmental distributions. Oxycline subnetworks were structured around keystone aerobic heterotrophs that correlated with nitrification rates and N2O supersaturations, linking N2O production and accumulation to taxa involved in organic matter remineralization. Keystone taxa implicated in anaerobic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in anoxic environments clustered together in a low-oxygen subnetwork that correlated positively with nitrification N2O yields and N2O production from denitrification. Close coupling between N2O producers and consumers in the anoxic basin is indicated by strong correlations between the low-oxygen subnetwork, PICRUSt2-predicted nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene abundances, and N2O undersaturation. This study implicates keystone taxa affiliated with common ODZ groups as a potential control on water column N2O cycling and provides a theoretical basis for further investigations into marine microbial interaction networks.}

Springtails (Collembola) are among the most abundant soil arthropods regulating soil fertility and flow of energy through above- and belowground food webs. However, the global distribution of springtail diversity and density, and how these relate to energy fluxes remains unknown. Here, using a global dataset representing 2470 sites, we estimate the~total soil springtail biomass at 27.5 megatons carbon, which is threefold higher than wild terrestrial vertebrates, and record peak densities up to 2 million individuals per square meter in the tundra. Despite a 20-fold biomass difference between the tundra and the tropics, springtail energy use (community metabolism) remains similar across the latitudinal gradient, owing to the changes in temperature with latitude. Neither springtail density nor community metabolism is predicted by local species richness, which is high in the tropics, but comparably high in some temperate forests and even tundra. Changes in springtail activity may emerge from latitudinal gradients in temperature, predation and resource limitation in soil communities. Contrasting relationships of biomass, diversity and activity of springtail communities with temperature suggest that climate warming will alter fundamental soil biodiversity metrics in different directions, potentially restructuring terrestrial food webs and affecting soil functioning.}

Here, we examine how technical biases and noise that are introduced into multivariate molecular data affect the estimation of the components of diversity (i.e., total number of different molecular species, or entities; total number of molecules; and the abundance distribution of molecular entities). We then explore under which conditions these biases affect the measurement of ɑ- and β-diversity and highlight how novel methods commonly used in community ecology can be adopted to improve the interpretation and integration of multivariate molecular data.}

Little is known about the conservation status of most soil organisms and the effects of nature conservation policies on soil systems. Yet like “canaries in the coal mine,” when soil organisms begin to disappear, ecosystems will soon start to underperform, potentially hindering their vital functions for humankind. Soil biodiversity and its ecosystem functions thus require explicit consideration when establishing nature protection priorities and policies and when designing new conservation areas. To inform such efforts, we lay out a global soil biodiversity and ecosystem function monitoring framework to be considered in the context of the post-2020 discussions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). To support this framework, we suggest a suite of soil ecological indicators based on essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) (2) (see the figure and table S3) that directly link to current global targets such as the ones established under the CBD, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement (table S1).}}

  abstract = {Despite advances in sequencing, lack of standardization makes comparisons across studies challenging and hampers insights into the structure and function of microbial communities across multiple habitats on a planetary scale. Here we present a multi-omics analysis of a diverse set of 880 microbial community samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data, and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry). We used standardized protocols and analytical methods to characterize microbial communities, focusing on relationships and co-occurrences of microbially related metabolites and microbial taxa across environments, thus allowing us to explore diversity at extraordinary scale. In addition to a reference database for metagenomic and metabolomic data, we provide a framework for incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of existing knowledge in the form of an evolving community resource. We demonstrate the utility of this database by testing the hypothesis that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere but the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both microbial communities and the environment, whereas the relative abundances of microbially related metabolites vary and co-occur with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner. We additionally show the power of certain chemistry, in particular terpenoids, in distinguishing Earth’s environments (for example, terrestrial plant surfaces and soils, freshwater and marine animal stool), as well as that of certain microbes including Conexibacter woesei (terrestrial soils), Haloquadratum walsbyi (marine deposits) and Pantoea dispersa (terrestrial plant detritus). This Resource provides insight into the taxa and metabolites within microbial communities from diverse habitats across Earth, informing both microbial and chemical ecology, and provides a foundation and methods for multi-omics microbiome studies of hosts and the environment.}

It is thus essential to identify general macroecological patterns related to the distribution and functioning of soil organisms to support their conservation and consideration by governance. These macroecological analyses need to represent the diversity of environmental conditions that can be found worldwide. Here we identify and characterize existing environmental gaps in soil taxa and ecosystem functioning data across soil macroecological studies and 17,186 sampling sites across the globe. These data gaps include important spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.3\% of all sampling sites having both information about biodiversity and function, although with different taxonomic groups and functions at each site. Based on this information, we provide clear priorities to support and expand soil macroecological research.}

Historically, soil assessments focused on crop production, but, today, soil health also includes the role of soil in water quality, climate change and human health. However, quantifying soil health is still dominated by chemical indicators, despite growing appreciation of the importance of soil biodiversity, owing to limited functional knowledge and lack of effective methods. In this Perspective, the definition and history of soil health are described and compared with other soil concepts. We outline ecosystem services provided by soils, the indicators used to measure soil functionality and their integration into informative soil-health indices. Scientists should embrace soil health as an overarching principle that contributes to sustainability goals, rather than only a property to measure.}

Here, using two independent global standardized field surveys, and a range of natural and human factors, we test the relationship between the number of environmental stressors exceeding different critical thresholds and the maintenance of multiple ecosystem services across biomes. Our analysis shows that having multiple stressors, from medium levels ({$>$}50\%), negatively and significantly correlates with impacts on ecosystem services and that having multiple stressors crossing a high-level critical threshold (over 75\% of maximum observed levels) reduces soil biodiversity and functioning globally. The number of environmental stressors exceeding the {$>$}75\% threshold was consistently seen as an important predictor of multiple ecosystem services, therefore improving prediction of ecosystem functioning. Our findings highlight the need to reduce the dimensionality of the human footprint on ecosystems to conserve biodiversity and function.}

We present a hierarchical framework for investigating macrosystems at any level of ecological organization and in relation to broader and finer scales. Building on well-established theory and concepts from other subdisciplines of ecology, we identify feedbacks, linkages among distant regions, and interactions that cross scales of space and time as the most likely sources of unexpected and novel behaviors in macrosystems.

Efforts are underway to increase the resilience of some ecosystems that are under threat, yet collective awareness and action are modest at best. Here, we highlight the potential for a biosphere resilience sensing system to make it easier to see where things are going wrong, and to see whether deliberate efforts to make things better are working. We focus on global resilience sensing of the terrestrial biosphere at high spatial and temporal resolution through satellite remote sensing, utilizing the generic mathematical behaviour of complex systems—loss of resilience corresponds to slower recovery from perturbations, gain of resilience equates to faster recovery. We consider what subset of biosphere resilience remote sensing can monitor, critically reviewing existing studies. Then we present illustrative, global results for vegetation resilience and trends in resilience over the last 20 years, from both satellite data and model simulations. We close by discussing how resilience sensing nested across global, biome-ecoregion, and local ecosystem scales could aid management and governance at these different scales, and identify priorities for further work.

We list more than 40 soil microbiome functions that either directly or indirectly contribute to soil, plant, animal and human health. We identify microorganisms that are shared between different one health compartments and show that soil, plant and human microbiomes are perhaps more interconnected than previously thought. Our Review further evaluates soil microbial contributions to one health in the light of dysbiosis and global change and demonstrates that microbial diversity is generally positively associated with one health. Finally, we present future challenges in one health research and formulate recommendations for practice and evaluation.}

We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying {$>$}30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent “axes of variation” shaped by markedly different processes.},

Determining the metabolic processes performed by microbial communities is crucial for understanding and managing ecosystem properties. Metagenomic approaches allow the elucidation of the main metabolic processes that determine the performance of microbial communities under different environmental conditions and perturbations. Here we present the first compartmentalized metabolic reconstruction at a metagenomics scale of a microbial ecosystem. This systematic approach conceives a meta-organism without boundaries between individual organisms and allows the in silico evaluation of the effect of agricultural intervention on soils at a metagenomics level. To characterize the microbial ecosystems, topological properties, taxonomic and metabolic profiles, as well as a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) were considered. Furthermore, topological and optimization algorithms were implemented to carry out the curation of the models, to ensure the continuity of the fluxes between the metabolic pathways, and to confirm the metabolite exchange between subcellular compartments. The proposed models provide specific information about ecosystems that are generally overlooked in non-compartmentalized or non-curated networks, like the influence of transport reactions in the metabolic processes, especially the important effect on mitochondrial processes, as well as provide more accurate results of the fluxes used to optimize the metabolic processes within the microbial community.},

Building a knowledge base (KB) consolidating these disconnected pieces is an essential first step to democratize and accelerate the process of accessing the collective discoveries of human disease connections to the human microbiome. In this article, we survey the existing tools and development efforts that have been produced to capture portions of the information needed to construct a KB of all known human microbiome-disease associations and highlight the need for additional innovations in natural language processing (NLP), text mining, taxonomic representations, and field-wide vocabulary standardization in human microbiome research.

Computational systems biology approaches can give further mechanistic insights by constructing data- or knowledge-driven networks that represent microbe interactions. In this minireview, we will discuss current approaches in systems biology to analyze the human gut microbiota, with a particular focus on constraint-based modeling.

These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20\% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.},

Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere.

  abstract = {What is the potential for synthetic biology as a way of engineering, on a large scale, complex ecosystems? Can it be used to change endangered ecological communities and rescue them to prevent their collapse? What are the best strategies for such ecological engineering paths to succeed? Is it possible to create stable, diverse synthetic ecosystems capable of persisting in closed environments? Can synthetic communities be created to thrive on planets different from ours? These and other questions pervade major future developments within synthetic biology. The goal of engineering ecosystems is plagued with all kinds of technological, scientific and ethic problems. In this paper, we consider the requirements for terraformation, i.e., for changing a given environment to make it hospitable to some given class of life forms. Although the standard use of this term involved strategies for planetary terraformation, it has been recently suggested that this approach could be applied to a very different context: ecological communities within our own planet. As discussed here, this includes multiple scales, from the gut microbiome to the entire biosphere.},

In this chapter, we highlight the importance and potential of ENA in future biomonitoring programs, as current biomonitoring indicators (e.g. species richness, population abundances of targeted species) are mostly descriptive and unable to characterize the mechanisms that underpin ecosystem functioning. Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches, especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels, but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are now within ecologists reach.},

  abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are vital in mediating the earth’s biogeochemical cycles; yet, despite our rapidly increasing ability to explore complex environmental microbial communities, the relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: ‘When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?’ We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.},

Yet, microbial ecology and its role in ecosystem biochemistry remain poorly understood, partly because the enormous diversity found in microbial communities hinders their modeling. Despite this diversity, the bulk of global biogeochemical fluxes is driven by a few metabolic pathways encoded by a small set of genes, which through time have spread across microbial clades that can replace each other within metabolic niches. Hence, the question arises whether the dynamics of these pathways can be modeled regardless of the hosting organisms, for example based on environmental conditions. Such a pathway-centric paradigm would greatly simplify the modeling of microbial processes at ecosystem scales.},

  abstract = {Resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding are among the main drivers of microbial community assembly. Yet the degree to which these two conflicting forces are reflected in the composition of natural communities has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to assess the potential for resource competition and metabolic cooperation in large co-occurring groups (up to 40 members) across thousands of habitats. Our analysis reveals two distinct community types, which are clustered at opposite ends of a spectrum in a trade-off between competition and cooperation. At one end are highly cooperative communities, characterized by smaller genomes and multiple auxotrophies. At the other end are highly competitive communities, which feature larger genomes and overlapping nutritional requirements, and harbour more genes related to antimicrobial activity. The latter are mainly present in soils, whereas the former are found in both free-living and host-associated habitats. Community-scale flux simulations show that, whereas competitive communities can better resist species invasion but not nutrient shift, cooperative communities are susceptible to species invasion but resilient to nutrient change. We also show, by analysing an additional data set, that colonization by probiotic species is positively associated with the presence of cooperative species in the recipient microbiome. Together, our results highlight the bifurcation between competitive and cooperative metabolism in the assembly of natural communities and its implications for community modulation.}

  abstract = {We review approaches to characterize metabolic interactions within microbial communities using Stoichiometric Metabolic Network (SMN) models for applications in environmental and industrial biotechnology. SMN models are computational tools used to evaluate the metabolic engineering potential of various organisms. They have successfully been applied to design and optimize the microbial production of antibiotics, alcohols and amino acids by single strains. To date however, such models have been rarely applied to analyze and control the metabolism of more complex microbial communities. This is largely attributed to the diversity of microbial community functions, metabolisms, and interactions. Here, we firstly review different types of microbial interaction and describe their relevance for natural and engineered environmental processes. Next, we provide a general description of the essential methods of the SMN modeling workflow including the steps of network reconstruction, simulation through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), experimental data gathering, and model calibration. Then we broadly describe and compare four approaches to model microbial interactions using metabolic networks, i.e., (i) lumped networks, (ii) compartment per guild networks, (iii) bilevel optimization simulations, and (iv) dynamic-SMN methods. These approaches can be used to integrate and analyze diverse microbial physiology, ecology and molecular community data. All of them (except the lumped approach) are suitable for incorporating species abundance data but so far they have been used only to model simple communities of two to eight different species. Interactions based on substrate exchange and competition can be directly modeled using the above approaches. However, interactions based on metabolic feedbacks, such as product inhibition and synthropy require extensions to current models, incorporating gene regulation and compounding accumulation mechanisms. SMN models of microbial interactions can be used to analyze complex “omics” data and to infer and optimize metabolic processes. Thereby, SMN models are suitable to capitalize on advances in high-throughput molecular and metabolic data generation. SMN models are starting to be applied to describe microbial interactions during wastewater treatment, in-situ bioremediation, microalgae blooms methanogenic fermentation, and bioplastic production. Despite their current challenges, we envisage that SMN models have future potential for the design and development of novel growth media, biochemical pathways and synthetic microbial associations.},

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.},

ABSTRACT={<sec>IntroductionTraditional chemical control methods pose a damaging effect on farmland ecology, and their long-term use has led to the development of pest resistance.</sec><sec>MethodsHere, we analyzed the correlations and differences in the microbiome present in the plant and soil of sugarcane cultivars exhibiting different insect resistance to investigate the role played by microbiome in crop insect resistance. We evaluated the microbiome of stems, topsoil, rhizosphere soil, and striped borers obtained from infested stems, as well as soil chemical parameters.</sec><sec>Results and DiscussionResults showed that microbiome diversity was higher in stems of insect-resistant plants, and contrast, lower in the soil of resistant plants, with fungi being more pronounced than bacteria. The microbiome in plant stems was almost entirely derived from the soil. The microbiome of insect-susceptible plants and surrounding soil tended to change towards that of insect-resistant plants after insect damage. Insects microbiome was mainly derived from plant stems and partly from the soil. Available potassium showed an extremely significant correlation with soil microbiome. This study validated the role played by the microbiome ecology of plant–soil-insect system in insect resistance and provided a pre-theoretical basis for crop resistance control.</sec>}

abstract = {Insects and other arthropods are central to terrestrial ecosystems. However, data are lacking regarding their global population abundance. We synthesized thousands of evaluations from around 500 sites worldwide, estimating the absolute biomass and abundance of terrestrial arthropods across different taxa and habitats. We found that there are 1 x 1019 (twofold uncertainty range) soil arthropods on Earth, 95\% of which are soil mites and springtails. The soil contains 200 (twofold uncertainty range) million metric tons (Mt) of dry biomass. Termites contribute 40\% of the soil biomass, much more than ants at 10\%. Our estimate for the global biomass of above-ground arthropods is more uncertain, highlighting a knowledge gap that future research should aim to close. We estimate the combined dry biomass of all terrestrial arthropods at 300 Mt (uncertainty range, 100 to 500), similar to the mass of humanity and its livestock. These estimates enhance the quantitative understanding of arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provide an initial holistic benchmark on their decline. Synthesizing local data quantifies arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provides an initial benchmark on their decline.}}

However, the natural histories and distributions of these organisms remain largely undocumented. Delgado-Baquerizo et al. provide a survey of the dominant bacterial taxa found around the world. In soil collections from six continents, they found that only 2\% of bacterial taxa account for nearly half of the soil bacterial communities across the globe. These dominant taxa could be clustered into ecological groups of co-occurring bacteria that share habitat preferences. The findings will allow for a more predictive understanding of soil bacterial diversity and distribution. Science, this issue p. 320 Relatively few soil bacterial taxa dominate terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, with predictable distributions and ecology. The immense diversity of soil bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed soils from 237 locations across six continents and found that only 2\% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the soil bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in soils globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of soil bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a most wanted list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based efforts aimed at improving our understanding of soil microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.}}

Little is known about their diversity and distribution at large spatial scales, despite the availability of considerable amounts of local-scale data. Earthworm diversity data, obtained from the primary literature or provided directly by authors, were collated with information on site locations, including coordinates, habitat cover, and soil properties. Datasets were required, at a minimum, to include abundance or biomass of earthworms at a site. Where possible, site-level species lists were included, as well as the abundance and biomass of individual species and ecological groups. This global dataset contains 10,840 sites, with 184 species, from 60 countries and all continents except Antarctica. The data were obtained from 182 published articles, published between 1973 and 2017, and 17 unpublished datasets. Amalgamating data into a single global database will assist researchers in investigating and answering a wide variety of pressing questions, for example, jointly assessing aboveground and belowground biodiversity distributions and drivers of biodiversity change.",

abstract="Soil organisms are a crucial part of the terrestrial biosphere. Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning, few quantitative, spatially explicit models of the active belowground community currently exist. In particular, nematodes are the most abundant animals on Earth, filling all trophic levels in the soil food web. Here we use 6,759 georeferenced samples to generate a mechanistic understanding of the patterns of the global abundance of nematodes in the soil and the composition of their functional groups. The resulting maps show that 1020 nematodes (with a total biomass of approximately 0.3gigatonnes) inhabit surface soils across the world, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions (38{\%} of total) than in temperate (24{\%}) or tropical (21{\%}) regions. Regional variations in these global trends also provide insights into local patterns of soil fertility and functioning. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing soil ecological processes in global biogeochemical models and will enable the prediction of elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios.",

ABSTRACT={The persistence of ecological systems in changing environments requires energy, materials, and information. Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: (i) what is information? (ii) how is information related to uncertainty? (iii) what is information processing? (iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.}

    abstract = { Valuing, managing and conserving marine biodiversity and a full range of ecosystem services is at the forefront of research and policy agendas. However, biodiversity is being lost at up to a thousand times the average background rate. Traditional disciplinary and siloed conservation approaches are not able to tackle this massive loss of biodiversity because they generally ignore or overlook the interactive and dynamic nature of ecosystems processes, limiting their predictability. To conserve marine biodiversity, we must assess the interactions and impacts among biodiversity and ecosystem services (BD-ES). The scaling up in complexity from single species to entire communities is necessary, albeit challenging, for a deeper understanding of how ecosystem services relate to biodiversity and the roles species have in ecosystem service provision. These interactions are challenging to map, let alone fully assess, but network and system-based approaches provide a powerful way to progress beyond those limitations. Here, we introduce a conceptual multi-layered network approach to understanding how ecosystem services supported by biodiversity drive the total service provision, how different stressors impact BD-ES and where conservation efforts should be placed to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity. This article is part of the theme issue Integrative research perspectives on marine conservation. }

The ultimate aim is a public, online, quality-vetted Map of Life that for every species integrates and visualizes available distributional knowledge, while also facilitating user feedback and dynamic biodiversity analyses. First milestones toward such an infrastructure have now been implemented.}

                   subunit and 288 717 large subunit rRNA gene
                   sequences. Since the initial description of the
                   project, substantial new features have been
                   introduced, including advanced quality control
                   procedures, an improved rRNA gene aligner, online
                   tools for probe and primer evaluation and optimized
                   browsing, searching and downloading on the website.
                   Furthermore, the extensively curated SILVA taxonomy
                   and the new non-redundant SILVA datasets provide an

                   methods to uncover key micro-organisms and processes
                   driving biogeochemical cycling in natural ecosystems.
                   Databases dedicated to depicting biogeochemical
                   pathways (for example, metabolism of
                   dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is an
                   abundant organosulfur compound) from
                   metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data are rarely seen.
                   Additionally, a recognized normalization model to
                   estimate the relative abundance and environmental
                   importance of pathways from metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic data has not been organized to
                   date. These limitations impact the ability to
                   accurately relate key microbial-driven biogeochemical
                   processes to differences in environmental conditions.
                   Thus, an easy-to-use, specialized tool that infers
                   and visually compares the potential for
                   biogeochemical processes, including DMSP cycling, is
                   urgently required. To solve these issues, we
                   developed DiTing, a tool wrapper to infer and compare
                   biogeochemical pathways among a set of given
                   metagenomic or metatranscriptomic reads in one step,
                   based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
                   (KEGG) and a manually created DMSP cycling gene
                   database. Accurate and specific formulae for over 100
                   pathways were developed to calculate their relative
                   abundance. Output reports detail the relative
                   abundance of biogeochemical pathways in both text and
                   graphical format. DiTing was applied to simulated
                   metagenomic data and resulted in consistent genetic
                   features of simulated benchmark genomic data.
                   Subsequently, when applied to natural metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic data from hydrothermal vents and
                   the Tara Ocean project, the functional profiles
                   predicted by DiTing were correlated with
                   environmental condition changes. DiTing can now be
                   confidently applied to wider metagenomic and
                   metatranscriptomic datasets, and it is available at
                   https://github.com/xuechunxu/DiTing.},

                   indispensable for modern marine research, providing
                   support to an increasing number and diversity of
                   users. Pairing with the impetus offered by
                   high-throughput methods to key areas such as
                   non-model organism studies, their operation
                   continuously evolves to meet the corresponding
                   computational challenges. Here, we present a Tier 2
                   (regional) HPC facility, operating for over a decade
                   at the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology,
                   and Aquaculture of the Hellenic Centre for Marine
                   Research in Greece. Strategic choices made in design
                   and upgrades aimed to strike a balance between depth
                   (the need for a few high-memory nodes) and breadth (a
                   number of slimmer nodes), as dictated by the
                   idiosyncrasy of the supported research. Qualitative
                   computational requirement analysis of the latter
                   revealed the diversity of marine fields, methods, and
                   approaches adopted to translate data into knowledge.
                   In addition, hardware and software architectures,
                   usage statistics, policy, and user management aspects
                   of the facility are presented. Drawing upon the last
                   decade's experience from the different levels of
                   operation of the Institute of Marine Biology,
                   Biotechnology, and Aquaculture HPC facility, a number
                   of lessons are presented; these have contributed to
                   the facility's future directions in light of emerging
                   distribution technologies (e.g., containers) and
                   Research Infrastructure evolution. In combination
                   with detailed knowledge of the facility usage and its

@inproceedings{page_text-mining_2019,
	abstract = {The taxonomic literature is one of the largest resources of information on biodiversity, both current and in the past. Unlike many scientific disciplines this literature remains perpetually relevant as successive taxonomic work builds upon those earlier foundations. Projects such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) have greatly increased access to that literature, as have numerous independent digitisation efforts by museums, herbaria, and publishers. But the focus of this access has been human readers, with limited use of text mining tools, mostly focussed on extracting taxonomic names. This talk explores other kinds of data that can be extracted from text on BHL and elsewhere, focusing on taxonomic names, geographic localities and specimen codes in the context of the BioStor project (https://biostor.org, Page 2011).
The problem of finding taxonomic names in text has been well studied (e.g., Akella et al. 2012), and new BHL content is continuously indexed by names. Despite this, there is only weak linkage between taxonomic name databases and BHL. Even projects that create these links (e.g., BioNames, Page 2013) do not enable links in the reverse direction. In other words, a BHL reader is unaware whether the appearance of a name on a page is the first publication of that name, nor are they told of the fate of a name in subsequent research. The absence of these links reduces the value of BHL to working taxonomists.
In addition to taxonomic names, a typical taxonomic paper often contains specimen codes. Extracting these from text and linking them to digital representations, such as occurrence records in GBIF, opens up the possibility to provide detailed provenance for occurrence data, as well as citation-based metrics for the utility of natural history collections.
Taxonomic papers are also often rich in geographic information. A simple method for extracting locality information from text is to search for latitude and longitude coordinates, and BioStor currently does this. To date some 83,000 individual point localities have been extracted (Fig. 1 ). These are used to provide a simple geographic search interface in BioStor, and are also harvested by JournalMap (Karl et al. 2013). But these localities are not linked to the original location in the source text, nor are they linked to any associated specimens, so they cannot be interpreted as occurrences that could be harvested by GBIF. If the goal is to contribute to GBIF then we need tools that can parse locality information and link that to associated specimens.
A general framework for handling data on taxonomic names, specimens, and geographic localities in text is to treat them as annotations (Batista-Navarro et al. 2017). By modelling annotations using the Web Annotation Data Model (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ ) we can incorporate these annotations into biodiversity knowledge graphs (Page 2016). We can also combine these annotations with new standards for describing digitised content, such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF, https://iiif.io). The implications of this approach for developing new interfaces to the biodiversity literature will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Maps depict natural and human-induced changes on earth at a fine resolution for large areas and over long periods of time. In addition, maps---especially historical maps---are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of digital map archives have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from archived images of maps (digital map processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information that can be used in spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image. This article presents an overview of existing map processing techniques, with the goal of bringing together the past and current research efforts in this interdisciplinary field, to characterize the advances that have been made, and to identify future research directions and opportunities.},

@article{sautter_semi-automated_2007,
	abstract = {Today, digitization of legacy literature is a big issue. This also applies to the domain of biosystematics, where this process has just started. Digitized  biosystematics literature requires a very precise and fine grained markup in order  to be useful for detailed search, data linkage and mining. However, manual markup on  sentence level and below is cumbersome and time consuming. In this paper, we present  and evaluate the GoldenGATE editor, which is designed for the special needs of  marking up OCR output with XML. It is built in order to support the user in this  process as far as possible: Its functionality ranges from easy, intuitive tagging  through markup conversion to dynamic binding of configurable plug-ins provided by  third parties. Our evaluation shows that marking up an OCR document using GoldenGATE  is three to four times faster than with an off-the-shelf XML editor like XML-Spy.  Using domain-specific NLP-based plug-ins, these numbers are even higher.},

@article{pyle_towards_2016,
	abstract = {For more than 250 years, the taxonomic enterprise has remained almost unchanged. Certainly, the tools of the trade have improved: months-long journeys aboard sailing ships have been reduced to hours aboard jet airplanes; advanced technology allows humans to access environments that were once utterly inaccessible; GPS has replaced crude maps; digital hi-resolution imagery provides far more accurate renderings of organisms that even the best commissioned artists of a century ago; and primitive candle-lit microscopes have been replaced by an array of technologies ranging from scanning electron microscopy to DNA sequencing. But the basic paradigm remains the same. Perhaps the most revolutionary change of all - which we are still in the midst of, and which has not yet been fully realized - is the means by which taxonomists manage and communicate the information of their trade. The rapid evolution in recent decades of computer database management software, and of information dissemination via the Internet, have both dramatically improved the potential for streamlining the entire taxonomic process. Unfortunately, the potential still largely exceeds the reality. The vast majority of taxonomic information is either not yet digitized, or digitized in a form that does not allow direct and easy access. Moreover, the information that is easily accessed in digital form is not yet seamlessly interconnected. In an effort to bring reality closer to potential, a loose affiliation of major taxonomic resources, including GBIF, the Encyclopedia of Life, NBII, Catalog of Life, ITIS, IPNI, ICZN, Index Fungorum, and many others have been crafting a "Global Names Architecture" (GNA). The intention of the GNA is not to replace any of the existing taxonomic data initiatives, but rather to serve as a dynamic index to interconnect them in a way that streamlines the entire taxonomic enterprise: from gathering specimens in the field, to publication of new taxa and related data.},

It is diagnosed that these changes are bound up with multi-media and multi-perspective facilities of annotation tools, in particular when considering virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, their potential ubiquitous use, and the exploitation of externally trained natural language pre-processing methods. Such developments potentially lead to a dynamic and exploratory heuristic construction of the annotation process. With TextAnnotator an annotation suite is introduced which focuses on multi-mediality and multi-perspectivity with an interoperable set of task-specific annotation modules (e.g., for word classification, rhetorical structures, dependency trees, semantic roles, and more) and their linkage to VR and mobile implementations. The basic architecture and usage of TextAnnotator is described and related to the above mentioned shifts in the field.},

Such data are now being collected, formatted and disseminated by MedOBIS (the Mediterranean Ocean Biogeographic Information System) initiative involving Greece, the Ukraine and Israel (test version available at: www.medobis.org). The aim is to develop a taxon-based biogeography database and online data server with links to survey and satellite environmental data. MedOBIS is currently undergoing 4 stages of development, namely, data assembly, formatting, analysis and dissemination. The primary features of the MedOBIS application are its offline GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data formatting capabilities and its online Java- and JavaScript-enabling data server with taxon-based search, mapping and data downloading capabilities. It is an independent source of biological and environmental data, as well as an online GIS tool designed to facilitate access to historical and current data by marine researchers. As more data become available and are inserted into the system, MedOBIS will function as the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea node of EurOBIS (the European node of the international OBIS initiative, part of the \&\#145;Census of Marine Life\&\#146;).},

@article{mora_how_2011,
	abstract = {Author Summary Knowing the number of species on Earth is one of the most basic yet elusive questions in science. Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts 8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) species globally, of which 2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86\% of the species on Earth, and 91\% in the ocean, still await description. Closing this knowledge gap will require a renewed interest in exploration and taxonomy, and a continuing effort to catalogue existing biodiversity data in publicly available databases.},

@article{martin_miguez_european_2019,
	abstract = {Marine data are needed for many purposes: for acquiring a better scientific understanding of the marine environment, but also, increasingly, as marine knowledge for decision making as well as developing products and services supporting economic growth. Data must be of sufficient quality to meet the specific users' needs. It must also be accessible in a timely manner. And yet, despite being critical, this timely access to known-quality data proves challenging. Europe's marine data have traditionally been collected by a myriad of entities with the result that much of our data are scattered throughout unconnected databases and repositories. Even when data are available, they are often not compatible, making the sharing of the information and data aggregation particularly challenging. In this paper, we present how the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet) has developed over the last decade to tackle these issues. Today, EMODnet is comprised of more than 150 organizations which gather marine data, metadata, and data products and make them more easily accessible for a wider range of users. EMODnet currently consists of seven sub-portals: bathymetry, geology, physics, chemistry, biology, seabed habitats, and human activities. In addition, Sea-basin Checkpoints have been established to assess the observation capacity in the North Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Baltic, Artic, and Black Sea. The Checkpoints identify whether the observation infrastructure in Europe meets the needs of users by undertaking a number of challenges. To complement this, a Data Ingestion Service has been set up to tackle the problem of the wealth of marine data that remain unavailable, by reaching out to data holders, explaining the benefits of sharing their data and offering a support service to assist them in releasing their data and making them available through EMODnet. The EMODnet Central Portal (www.emodnet.eu) provides a single point of access to these services, which are free to access and use. The strategic vision of EMODnet in the next decade is also presented, together with key focal areas toward a more user-oriented service, including EMODnet for business, internationalization for global users, and stakeholder engagement to connect the diverse communities across the marine knowledge value chain.},

	abstract = {Data sharing is the practice of making data available for use by others. Ecologists are increasingly generating and sharing an immense volume of data. Such data may serve to augment existing data collections and can be used for synthesis efforts such as meta-analysis, for parameterizing models, and for verifying research results (i.e., study reproducibility). Large volumes of ecological data may be readily available through institutions or data repositories that are the most comprehensive available and can serve as the core of ecological analysis. Ecological data are also employed outside the research context and are used for decision-making, natural resource management, education, and other purposes. Data sharing has a long history in many domains such as oceanography and the biodiversity sciences (e.g., taxonomic data and museum specimens), but has emerged relatively recently in the ecological sciences. A review of several of the large international and national ecological research programs that have emerged since the mid-1900s highlights the initial failures and more recent successes as well as the underlying causes---from a near absence of effective policies to the emergence of community and data sharing policies coupled with the development and adoption of data and metadata standards and enabling tools. Sociocultural change and the move towards more open science have evolved more rapidly over the past two decades in response to new requirements set forth by governmental organizations, publishers and professional societies. As the scientific culture has changed so has the cyberinfrastructure landscape. The introduction of community-based data repositories, data and metadata standards, software tools, persistent identifiers, and federated search and discovery have all helped promulgate data sharing. Nevertheless, there are many challenges and opportunities especially as we move towards more open science. Cyberinfrastructure challenges include a paucity of easy-to-use metadata management systems, significant difficulties in assessing data quality and provenance, and an absence of analytical and visualization approaches that facilitate data integration and harmonization. Challenges and opportunities abound in the sociocultural arena where funders, researchers, and publishers all have a stake in clarifying policies, roles and responsibilities, as well as in incentivizing data sharing. A set of best practices and examples of software tools are presented that can enable research transparency, reproducibility and new knowledge by facilitating idea generation, research planning, data management and the dissemination of data and results.},

It currently contains 3.5 million distinct pages for taxa and provides content for 1.3 million of those pages. The content is primarily contributed by EOL content partners (providers) that have a more limited geographic, taxonomic or topical scope. EOL aggregates these data and automatically integrates them based on associated scientific names and other classification information. EOL also provides interfaces for curation and direct content addition. All materials in EOL are either in the public domain or licensed under a Creative Commons license. In addition to the web interface, EOL is also accessible through an Application Programming Interface.
In this paper, we review recent developments added for Version 2 of the web site and subsequent releases through Version 2.2, which have made EOL more engaging, personal, accessible and internationalizable. We outline the core features and technical architecture of the system. We summarize milestones achieved so far by EOL to present results of the current system implementation and establish benchmarks upon which to judge future improvements.
We have shown that it is possible to successfully integrate large amounts of descriptive biodiversity data from diverse sources into a robust, standards-based, dynamic, and scalable infrastructure. Increasing global participation and the emergence of EOL-powered applications demonstrate that EOL is becoming a significant resource for anyone interested in biological diversity.},

However, the need for environmental semantics is common to a multitude of fields, and ENVO's use has steadily grown since its initial description. We have thus expanded, enhanced, and generalised the ontology to support its increasingly diverse applications.},

This translation facilitates the understanding of biological processes under normal or disease conditions. Researchers aiming to identify the similarities and differences between organisms at the molecular level need resources collecting multi-organism tissue expression data. We have developed a database of gene--tissue associations in human, mouse, rat and pig by integrating multiple sources of evidence: transcriptomics covering all four species and proteomics (human only), manually curated and mined from the scientific literature. Through a scoring scheme, these associations are made comparable across all sources of evidence and across organisms. Furthermore, the scoring produces a confidence score assigned to each of the associations. The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly accessible through a user-friendly web interface and as part of the STRING app for Cytoscape. In addition, we analyzed the agreement between datasets, across and within organisms, and identified that the agreement is mainly affected by the quality of the datasets rather than by the technologies used or organisms compared.Database URL: http://tissues.jensenlab.org/},

The identification of named biological entities in text is a central and difficult task. We have developed an efficient algorithm and implementation of a dictionary-based approach to named entity recognition, which we here use to identify names of species and other taxa in text. The tool, SPECIES, is more than an order of magnitude faster and as accurate as existing tools. The precision and recall was assessed both on an existing gold-standard corpus and on a new corpus of 800 abstracts, which were manually annotated after the development of the tool. The corpus comprises abstracts from journals selected to represent many taxonomic groups, which gives insights into which types of organism names are hard to detect and which are easy. Finally, we have tagged organism names in the entire Medline database and developed a web resource, ORGANISMS, that makes the results accessible to the broad community of biologists. The SPECIES software is open source and can be downloaded from http://species.jensenlab.org along with dictionary files and the manually annotated goldstandard corpus. The ORGANISMS web resource can be found at http://organisms.jensenlab.org.},

@article{le_guillarme_taxonerd_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Easy access to multi-taxa information (e.g. distribution, traits, diet) in the scientific literature is essential to understand, map and predict all-inclusive biodiversity. Tools are needed to automatically extract useful information from the ever-growing corpus of ecological texts and feed this information to open data repositories. A prerequisite is the ability to recognise mentions of taxa in text, a special case of named entity recognition (NER). In recent years, deep learning-based NER systems have become ubiquitous, yielding state-of-the-art results in the general and biomedical domains. However, no such tool is available to ecologists wishing to extract information from the biodiversity literature. We propose a new tool called TaxoNERD that provides deep neural network (DNN) models to recognise taxon mentions in ecological documents. To achieve high performance, these models usually need to be trained on a large corpus of manually annotated text. Creating such a corpus is a laborious and costly process, with the result that manually annotated corpora in the ecological domain tend to be too small to learn an accurate DNN model from scratch. To address this issue, we leverage existing models pretrained on large biomedical corpora using transfer learning. The performance of our models is evaluated on four corpora and compared to the most popular taxonomic entity recognition tools. Our experiments suggest that existing taxonomic NER tools are not suited to the extraction of ecological information from text as they performed poorly on ecologically oriented corpora, either because they do not take account of the variability of taxon naming practices or because they do not generalise well to the ecological domain. Conversely, a domain-specific DNN-based tool like TaxoNERD outperformed the other approaches on an ecological information extraction task. Efforts are needed to raise ecological information extraction to the same level of performance as its biomedical counterpart. One promising direction is to leverage the huge corpus of unlabelled ecological texts to learn a language representation model that could benefit downstream tasks. These efforts could be highly beneficial to ecologists on the long term.},

@article{lyal_digitising_2016,
	abstract = {By digitising legacy taxonomic literature using XML mark-up the contents become accessible to other taxonomic and nomenclatural information systems. Appropriate schemas need to be interoperable with other sectorial schemas, atomise to appropriate content elements and carry appropriate metadata to, for example, enable algorithmic assessment of availability of a name under the Code. Legacy (and new) literature delivered in this fashion will become part of a global taxonomic resource from which users can extract tailored content to meet their particular needs, be they nomenclatural, taxonomic, faunistic or other.
To date, most digitisation of taxonomic literature has led to a more or less simple digital copy of a paper original -- the output of the many efforts has effectively been an electronic copy of a traditional library. While this has increased accessibility of publications through internet access, the means by which many scientific papers are indexed and located is much the same as with traditional libraries. OCR and born-digital papers allow use of web search engines to locate instances of taxon names and other terms, but OCR efficiency in recognising taxonomic names is still relatively poor, people's ability to use search engines effectively is mixed, and many papers cannot be searched directly. Instead of building digital analogues of traditional publications, we should consider what properties we require of future taxonomic information access. Ideally the content of each new digital publication should be accessible in the context of all previous published data, and the user able to retrieve nomenclatural, taxonomic and other data / information in the form required without having to scan all of the original papers and extract target content manually. This opens the door to dynamic linking of new content with extant systems: automatic population and updating of taxonomic catalogues, ZooBank and faunal lists, all descriptions of a taxon and its children instantly accessible with a single search, comparison of classifications used in different publications, and so on. A means to do this is through marking up content into XML, and the more atomised the mark-up the greater the possibilities for data retrieval and integration. Mark-up requires XML that accommodates the required content elements and is interoperable with other XML schemas, and there are now several written to do this, particularly TaxPub, taxonX and taXMLit, the last of these being the most atomised. We now need to automate this process as far as possible. Manual and automatic data and information retrieval is demonstrated by projects such as INOTAXA and Plazi. As we move to creating and using taxonomic products through the power of the internet, we need to ensure the output, while satisfying in its production the requirements of the Code, is fit for purpose in the future.},

	abstract = {Current trends in marine ecosystems need to be interpreted against a solid understanding of the magnitude and drivers of past changes. Over the last decade, marine scientists from different disciplines have engaged in the emerging field of marine historical ecology to reconstruct past changes in the sea. Here we review the diversity of approaches used and resulting patterns of historical changes in large marine mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Across 256 reviewed records, exploited populations declined 89\% from historical abundance levels (range: 11--100\%). In many cases, long-term fluctuations are related to climate variation, rapid declines to overexploitation and recent recoveries to conservation measures. These emerging historical patterns offer new insights into past ecosystems, and provide important context for contemporary ocean management.},

	abstract = {As a discipline, marine historical ecology (MHE) has contributed significantly to our understanding of the past state of the marine environment when levels of human impact were often very different from those today. What is less widely known is that insights from MHE have made headway into being applied within the context of present-day and long-term management and policy. This study draws attention to the applied value of MHE. We demonstrate that a broad knowledge base exists with potential for management application and advice, including the development of baselines and reference levels. Using a number of case studies from around the world, we showcase the value of historical ecology in understanding change and emphasize how it either has already informed management or has the potential to do so soon. We discuss these case studies in a context of the science--policy interface around six themes that are frequently targeted by current marine and maritime policies: climate change, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem structure, habitat integrity, food security, and human governance. We encourage science--policy bodies to actively engage with contributions from MHE, as well-informed policy decisions need to be framed within the context of historical reference points and past resource or ecosystem changes.},

The document discusses some general concepts, including a definition of datasets, incentives to publish data and licenses for data publishing. Further, it defines and compares several routes for data publishing, namely as (1) supplementary files to research articles, which may be made available directly by the publisher, or (2) published in a specialized open data repository with a link to it from the research article, or (3) as a data paper, i.e., a specific, stand-alone publication describing a particular dataset or a collection of datasets, or (4) integrated narrative and data publishing through online import/download of data into/from manuscripts, as provided by the Biodiversity Data Journal.
The paper also contains detailed instructions on how to prepare and peer review data intended for publication, listed under the Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers, respectively. Special attention is given to existing standards, protocols and tools to facilitate data publishing, such as the Integrated Publishing Toolkit of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF IPT) and the DarwinCore Archive (DwC-A).

Large-scale mining of information from the literature is necessary if biology is to transform into a data-driven science. A computer can handle the volume but cannot make sense of the language. This paper reviews and discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to extract information from systematic literature. NLP algorithms have been used for decades, but require special development for application in the biological realm due to the special nature of the language. Many tools exist for biological information extraction (cellular processes, taxonomic names, and morphological characters), but none have been applied life wide and most still require testing and development. Progress has been made in developing algorithms for automated annotation of taxonomic text, identification of taxonomic names in text, and extraction of morphological character information from taxonomic descriptions. This manuscript will briefly discuss the key steps in applying information extraction tools to enhance biodiversity science.},

	abstract = {Abstract The RECovery of Logbooks and International Marine data (RECLAIM) project is a concerted, international effort to facilitate and encourage the recovery?through imaging and digitisation?of archived marine weather observations, platform and instrumental metadata and historical documentation, from many different countries. Non-instrumental observations of wind and weather have been recorded in ships' logbooks for hundreds of years, augmented by systematic instrumental observations of sea surface and air temperatures, barometric pressure and other meteorological (and oceanographic) elements largely since the mid-nineteenth century. Once digitised, these data are widely useful for climate studies and other avenues of scientific research?including oceanography, fisheries, maritime history and ecology?thus improvements seeking to address gaps and weaknesses in the currently available data record can be of major importance. In addition to documenting and prioritising archived ship logbook records for imaging and digitisation in support of that goal, RECLAIM provides expert assistance in the interpretation of historical marine records in relation to navigation, observational practices and recording. Since the project inception in 2005, RECLAIM has facilitated, for example, recovery of logbooks of the Dutch and English East India Companies in the nineteenth century, and of the British Royal Navy of the twentieth century. Currently the project website includes reference lists, rescued UK and US marine documents, extensive UK archive reports and detailed inventories of ship movements. A variety of other developing international linkages are discussed, including to Chilean, Dutch, French, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and US historical records. ?

@article{vandepitte_fishing_2015,
	abstract = {Being able to assess the quality and level of completeness of data has become indispensable in marine biodiversity research, especially when dealing with large databases that typically compile data from a variety of sources. Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records---passing a specific combination of these QC steps---is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves. Through LifeWatch, users can already upload their own data and check them against a selection of the here described quality control procedures.Database URL : www.eurobis.org ( www.iobis.org ; www.emodnet-biology.eu/ )},

Historical collections are particularly rich in types and also represent a model of the biodiversity of marine life at the time of the collection, often centuries ago. The taxonomic and systematic importance of collections is well appreciated, as is the significance of time series of data in this period of anthropogenic environmental change. The application of new techniques increases the value of collected material even further, for example, molecular biology techniques allowing the recognition of new (often cryptic) taxa and their distributions, and stable isotope analyses releasing information on past and present ontogenies, geographical distributions and diets. Moreover the new era of information technology with associated digitization enables the release of the information stored in the collections to the scientists of the world.},

	abstract = {There are more than 1.2 billion biological specimens in the world's museums and herbaria. These objects are particularly important forms of biological sample and observation. They underpin biological taxonomy but the data they contain have many other uses in the biological and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, from their conception they are almost entirely documented on paper, either as labels attached to the specimens or in catalogues linked with catalogue numbers. In order to make the best use of these data and to improve the findability of these specimens, these data must be transcribed digitally and made to conform to standards, so that these data are also interoperable and reusable.Through various digitization projects, the authors have experimented with transcription by volunteers, expert technicians, scientists, commercial transcription services and automated systems. We have also been consumers of specimen data for taxonomical, biogeographical and ecological research. In this paper, we draw from our experiences to make specific recommendations to improve transcription data. The paper is split into two sections. We first address issues related to database implementation with relevance to data transcription, namely versioning, annotation, unknown and incomplete data and issues related to language. We then focus on particular data types that are relevant to biological collection specimens, namely nomenclature, dates, geography, collector numbers and uniquely identifying people. We make recommendations to standards organizations, software developers, data scientists and transcribers to improve these data with the specific aim of improving interoperability between collection datasets.},

	abstract = {Place name mentions in text may have more than one potential referent (e.g. Peru, the country vs. Peru, the city in Indiana). The Edinburgh Language Technology Group (LTG) has developed the Edinburgh Geoparser, a system that can automatically recognise place name mentions in text and disambiguate them with respect to a gazetteer. The recognition step is required to identify location mentions in a given piece of text. The subsequent disambiguation step, generally referred to as georesolution, grounds location mentions to their corresponding gazetteer entries with latitude and longitude values, for example, to visualise them on a map. Geoparsing is not only useful for mapping purposes but also for making document collections more accessible as it can provide additional metadata about the geographical content of documents. Combined with other information mined from text such as person names and date expressions, complex relations between such pieces of information can be identified. The Edinburgh Geoparser can be used with several gazetteers including Unlock and GeoNames to process a variety of input texts. The original version of the Geoparser was a demonstrator configured for modern text. Since then, it has been adapted to georeference historic and ancient text collections as well as modern-day newspaper text.1,2,3,4 Currently, the LTG is involved in three research projects applying the Geoparser to historical text collections of very different types and for a variety of end-user applications.

It is presented as a Linked Open Dataset generated from scientific literature. OpenBiodiv encompasses data extracted from more than 5000 scholarly articles published by Pensoft and many more taxonomic treatments extracted by Plazi from journals of other publishers. The data from both sources are converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and integrated in a graph database using the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and an RDF version of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomic backbone.

@article{herrmann_building_2020,
	abstract = {In 2016 the United Nations published the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It quickly became clear that information is a catalyst for almost every goal, and enhancing information access is necessary to achieve and ultimately improve global community life. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is therefore an invaluable resource for redressing inequallities as it provides information and literature as an open access library. But there are also still hurdles to overcome to ensure information for all. In the following, we will focus on technical developments outlined in the BHL's technical strategy. One challenge is the different digital infrastructures resulting in limited access to the web-based BHL. In 2019, only 53.6\% of the global population accessed the internet (Clement 2020). Even if the reasons for this are diverse, we assume that network coverage is a problem we have to address. One focus of the BHL's technical strategy is to support and provide solutions for remote areas with no or low bandwidth connection. Furthermore the technical strategy focuses on the provision of services and tools for various usage scenarios by implementing a responsive design. In 2019, mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, accounted for 54\% of all page views worldwide (Poleshova 2020). Even though a differentiated view must be taken of which devices are used for which scenario, it can be assumed that mobile devices will be used more frequently in everyday scientific life, for example in field research. By a responsive design of the BHL website, we address this trend in technological development and media usage in order to remain a user-friendly research infrastructure in the future.Another challenge is the multilingual user experience. The multilingualism of BHL will become an essential part of the technological development to address the global biodiversity community and to reflect the worldwide biodiversity research. We aim to achieve this through a multilingual user interface and multilingual search options. The services and tools mentioned above require a high quality database, especially machine-readable text. The improvement of optical character recognition (OCR) is fundamentally important for further technological developments. Good OCR results ensure a comprehensive search in the entire corpus, and with further technological possibilities, data could be added that goes beyond the pure text. Currently taxonomic names are parsed and linked to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), giving users the opportunities to search for taxonomic synonyms. In the future, this enrichment could be used for more data, such as collection data, geographical names, etc. In the challenge of improving and enriching the data, the BHL will depend on its large community, for example in crowdsourcing transcription projects. In order to reach those objectives and to continue to offer BHL's services to the global community in the best possible way, we need to monitor best practices in digital library and bioinformatics developments and implement them wherever possible. The BHL consortium will have to rely on partnerships and collaborations to fulfill this plan. We are therefore looking into cooperation with other consortia and will also explore alternative technological development models where third parties would develop apps and services from open BHL data. Taking all the mentioned approaches into account, the BHL will develop from a mainly literature library to a data library. It will be our task to create open source software and tools, like better APIs, to support the re-use of the data. This goes along with the aim to increase the awareness of the BHL within the biodiversity community as it is set in the BHL Strategic Plan 2020-2025 (Biodiversity Heritage Library 2020).To draw a conclusion, the BHL's technical strategy focuses on five main objectives to advance information access for the biodiversity community worldwide:  Improve global awareness and accessibilityEnhance machine-readability of BHL content for data re-useIdentify resources needed to achieve the technical planEnsure continued priorities and leadership for technical infrastructureImplement BHL 2020 Technical Priority Plan (Biodiversity Heritage Library 2020).The principle of our work is to adapt BHL to current technological, scientific and social developments in order to provide the global community with the best possible research tool for biodiversity research and to enhance the achievement of the SDGs.},

An essential step towards understanding global patterns of biodiversity is to provide a standardized view of these heterogeneous data sources to improve interoperability. Fundamental to this advance are definitions of common terms. This paper describes the evolution and development of Darwin Core, a data standard for publishing and integrating biodiversity information. We focus on the categories of terms that define the standard, differences between simple and relational Darwin Core, how the standard has been implemented, and the community processes that are essential for maintenance and growth of the standard. We present case-study extensions of the Darwin Core into new research communities, including metagenomics and genetic resources. We close by showing how Darwin Core records are integrated to create new knowledge products documenting species distributions and changes due to environmental perturbations.},

@article{levin_problem_1992,
	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

@article{poelen_global_2014,
	abstract = {An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

@article{dimitrova_pensoft_2020,
	abstract = {IntroductionDigitisation of biodiversity knowledge from collections, scholarly literature and various research documents is an ongoing mission of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) community. Organisations such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library make historical biodiversity literature openly available and develop tools to allow biodiversity data reuse and interoperability. For instance, Plazi transforms free text into machine-readable formats and extracts collection data and feeds it into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and other aggregators. All of these digitisation workflows require a lot of effort to develop and implement in practice. In essence, what these digitisation activities entail are the mapping of free text to concepts from recognised vocabularies or ontologies in order to make the content understandable to computers. AimWe aim to address the problem of mapping free text to ontological terms ("strings to things") with our tool for text-to-ontology mapping: the Pensoft Annotator.Methods \& ImplementationThe Annotator is a web application that performs direct text matching to terms from any ontology or vocabulary list given as input to the Annotator. The term 'ontology' is used loosely here and means a collection of terms and their synonyms, where terms are uniquely identified via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The Annotator accepts any of the following ontology formats (e.g. OBO, OWL, RDF/XML, etc.) but does not require the existence of a proper ontology structure (logical statements). We use the ROBOT command line tool to convert any of these formats to JSON. After the upload of a new ontology, the Annotator processes the ontology terms by normalising all exact synonyms and by removing all of the other synonyms (related, narrow and broad synonyms). This is done to limit the number of false positive matches and to preserve the semantic similarity between the matched ontology term and the text.After matching the words in the input text and the ontology term labels, the Pensoft Annotator returns a table of matched ontology terms including the following fields: the identifier of the ontology term, the ontology term label or the label of the synonym, the starting position of the matched term in the text, the term context (words surrounding the matched term in the text), the type of ontology term (class or property), the ontology from which the matched term originates and the number of times a given term is mentioned in the text. The Pensoft Annotator allows simultaneous annotation with multiple ontologies. To better visualise the exact ontology from which a matching term has been found, the terms are highlighted in different colour depending on the ontology. The Pensoft Annotator is also accessible programmatically via an Application Programming Interface (API), documented at https://annotator.pensoft.net/api.Discussion \& Use CasesThe Pensoft Annotator provides functionalities that will aid the transformation of free text to collections of semantic resources. However, it still requires expert knowledge to use as the ontologies need to be selected carefully. Some false positive matches from the annotation are possible because we do not perform semantic analysis of the texts. False negatives are also possible since there might be different word forms of ontology terms, which are not direct matches to them (e.g. 'wolf' and 'wolves'). For this reason, matched terms can be reviewed and removed from the results within the web interface of the Pensoft Annotator. After removal of terms, they will not be present in the downloaded results. The Pensoft Annotator can be used to annotate biodiversity and taxonomic literature to help with the extraction of biodiversity knowledge (e.g. species habitat preferences, species interaction data, localities, biogeographic data). The existence of some domain and taxon-specific ontologies, such as the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology, provides further opportunities for context-specific annotation. Semantic analysis of unstructured texts could be applied in addition to ontology annotation to improve the accuracy of ontology term matching and to filter out mismatched terms. Annotation of structured or semi-structured text (e.g. tables) can be done with better success. A recent example demonstrates the use of the Annotator to extract biotic interactions from tables (Dimitrova et al. 2020). The Annotator could also be used for ontology analysis and comparison. Annotation of text can help to discover gaps in ontologies as well as inaccurate synonyms. For instance, a certain word could be recognised as an ontology term match because it is an exact synonym in the ontology but in reality it might be more accurate to mark it as a related synonym. In addition, annotation with multiple ontologies can help to elucidate links between ontologies.},

	abstract = {Old maps are increasingly used as a source for historical research. This is a consequence of the increased availability of old maps in digital form, of the emergence of user-friendly Geographical Information Systems, and of a heightened awareness of the unique information stored in old maps. As with every source for historical studies, when old maps are georeferenced and information is extracted for historical research, the accuracy and reliability of the geometric and semantic information must be assessed. In this paper, a method based on a series of geometric transformations is presented, which transforms control points of a modern reference map to the coordinate system of an old map. Based on these transformed points, the planimetric and geodetic accuracy of the old map can be computationally analyzed and various visualizations of space deformation can be generated. The results are graphical representations of map distortion, such as distortion grids or displacement vectors, as well as statistical and geodetic measures describing the map geometry (e.g., map scale, rotation angle, and map projection). The visualizations help to assess the geometric accuracy of historical geographical information before using the data for geo-historical studies. The visualizations can also provide valuable information to the map historian about the history of a particular map and its creation.},

@article{arnaboldi_text_2020,
	abstract = {Biological knowledgebases rely on expert biocuration of the research literature to maintain up-to-date collections of data organized in machine-readable form. To enter information into knowledgebases, curators need to follow three steps: (i) identify papers containing relevant data, a process called triaging; (ii) recognize named entities; and (iii) extract and curate data in accordance with the underlying data models. WormBase (WB), the authoritative repository for research data on Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes, uses text mining (TM) to semi-automate its curation pipeline. In addition, WB engages its community, via an Author First Pass (AFP) system, to help recognize entities and classify data types in their recently published papers. In this paper, we present a new WB AFP system that combines TM and AFP into a single application to enhance community curation. The system employs string-searching algorithms and statistical methods (e.g. support vector machines (SVMs)) to extract biological entities and classify data types, and it presents the results to authors in a web form where they validate the extracted information, rather than enter it de novo as the previous form required. With this new system, we lessen the burden for authors, while at the same time receive valuable feedback on the performance of our TM tools. The new user interface also links out to specific structured data submission forms, e.g. for phenotype or expression pattern data, giving the authors the opportunity to contribute a more detailed curation that can be incorporated into WB with minimal curator review. Our approach is generalizable and could be applied to additional knowledgebases that would like to engage their user community in assisting with the curation. In the five months succeeding the launch of the new system, the response rate has been comparable with that of the previous AFP version, but the quality and quantity of the data received has greatly improved.},

This paper argues that as sets of heterogeneous databases are made to converge, there is a layering of values into the emergent infrastructure. It is argued that this layering process is relatively irreversible, and that it operates simultaneously at a very concrete level (fields in a database) and at a very abstract one (the coding of the relationship between the disciplines and the production of a general ontology). Finally, it is maintained that science studies as a discipline is able to (and should) make a significant contribution to the design of robust and flexible databases which recognize this performative character of infrastructure.},

@article{mouquet_review_2015,
	abstract = {In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used. Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.},

@article{rivera-quiroz_extracting_2019,
	abstract = {Traditional taxonomic publications have served as a biological data repository accumulating vast amounts of data on species diversity, geographical and temporal distributions, ecological interactions, taxonomic relations, among many other types of information. However, the fragmented nature of taxonomic literature has made this data difficult to access and use to its full potential. Current anthropogenic impact on biodiversity demands faster knowledge generation, but also making better use of what we already have. This could help us make better-informed decisions about conservation and resources management.
  In past years, several efforts have been made to make taxonomic literature more mobilized and accessible. These include online publications, open access journals, the digitization of old paper literature and improved availability through online specialized repositories such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and the World Spider Catalog (WSC), among others. Although easy to share, PDF publications still have most of their biodiversity data embedded in strings of text making them less dynamic and more difficult or impossible to read and analyze without a human interpreter. Recently developed tools as GoldenGATE-Imagine (GGI) allow transforming PDFs in XML files that extract and categorize taxonomically relevant data. These data can then be aggregated in databases such as Plazi TreatmentBank, where it can be re-explored, queried and analyzed.
  Here we combined several of these cybertaxonomic tools to test the data extraction process for one potential application: the design and planning of an expedition to collect fresh material in the field. We targeted the ground spider Teutamus politus and other related species from the Teutamus group (TG) (Araneae; Liocranidae). These spiders are known from South East Asia and have been cataloged in the family Liocranidae; however, their relations, biology and evolution are still poorly understood. We marked-up 56 publications that contained taxonomic treatments with specimen records for the Liocranidae. Of these publications, 20 contained information on members of the TG. Geographical distributions and occurrences of 90 TG species were analyzed based on 1,309 specimen records. These data were used to design our field collection in a way that allowed us to optimize the collection of adult specimens of our target taxa.
  The TG genera were most common in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. From these, Thailand was the second richest but had the most records of T. politus. Seasonal distribution of TG specimens in Thailand suggested June and July as the best time for collecting adults. Based on these analyses, we decided to sample from mid-July to mid-August 2018 in the three Thai provinces that combined most records of TG species and T. politus.
  Relying on the results of our literature analyses and using standard collection methods for ground spiders, we captured at least one specimen of every TG genus reported for Thailand. Our one-month expedition captured 231 TG spiders; from these, T. politus was the most abundant species with 188 specimens (95 adults). By comparison, a total of 196 specimens of the TG and 66 of T. politus had been reported for the same provinces in the last 40 years. Our sampling greatly increased the number of available specimens, especially for the genera Teutamus and Oedignatha. Also, we extended the known distribution of Oedignatha and Sesieutes within Thailand.
  These results illustrate the relevance of making biodiversity data contained within taxonomic treatments accessible and reusable. It also exemplifies one potential use of taxonomic legacy data: to more efficiently use existing biodiversity data to fill knowledge gaps. A similar approach can be used to study neglected or interesting taxa and geographic areas, generating a better biodiversity documentation that could aid in decision making, management and conservation.},

This paper focuses on a particularly troublesome class of data, termed dark data. ``Dark data'' is not carefully indexed and stored so it becomes nearly invisible to scientists and other potential users and therefore is more likely to remain underutilized and eventually lost. The article discusses how the concepts from long-tail economics can be used to understand potential solutions for better curation of this data. The paper describes why this data is critical to scientific progress, some of the properties of this data, as well as some social and technical barriers to proper management of this class of data. Many potentially useful institutional, social, and technical solutions are under development and are introduced in the last sections of the paper, but these solutions are largely unproven and require additional research and development.},

@article{michener_nongeospatial_1997,
	abstract = {Issues related to data preservation and sharing are receiving increased attention from scientific societies, funding agencies, and the broad scientific community. Ecologists, for example, are increasingly using data collected by other scientists to address questions at broader spatial, temporal, and thematic scales (e.g., global change, biodiversity, sustainability). No data set is perfect and self-explanatory. Ecologists must, therefore, rely upon a set of instructions or documentation to acquire a specific data set, determine its suitability for meeting specific research objectives, and accurately interpret results from subsequent processing, analysis, and modeling. ``Metadata'' represent the set of instructions or documentation that describe the content, context, quality, structure, and accessibility of a data set. Although geospatial metadata standards have been developed and widely endorsed by the geographical science community, such standards do not yet exist for the ecological sciences. In this paper, we examine potential benefits and costs associated with developing and implementing metadata for nongeospatial ecological data. We present a set of generic metadata descriptors that could serve as the basis for a ``metadata standard'' for nongeospatial ecological data. Alternative strategies for metadata implementation that meet differing organizational or investigator-specific objectives are presented. Finally, we conclude with several recommendations related to future development and implementation of ecological metadata.},

Measuring the magnitude and rate of change more effectively requires access to organized, easily discoverable, and digitally-formatted biodiversity data, both legacy and new, from across the globe. Assembling this coherent digital representation of biodiversity requires the integration of data that have historically been analog, dispersed, and heterogeneous. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a software package developed to support biodiversity dataset publication in a common format. The IPT's two primary functions are to 1) encode existing species occurrence datasets and checklists, such as records from natural history collections or observations, in the Darwin Core standard to enhance interoperability of data, and 2) publish and archive data and metadata for broad use in a Darwin Core Archive, a set of files following a standard format. Here we discuss the key need for the IPT, how it has developed in response to community input, and how it continues to evolve to streamline and enhance the interoperability, discoverability, and mobilization of new data types beyond basic Darwin Core records. We close with a discussion how IPT has impacted the biodiversity research community, how it enhances data publishing in more traditional journal venues, along with new features implemented in the latest version of the IPT, and future plans for more enhancements.},

	abstract = {Author summary Organism traits determine the role of species in economies and ecosystems, and the expression of those traits relies on interactions between an organism's genes and environment. The key to predicting trait expression is having a large pool of data to derive models, but most organism trait observations are recorded in ways that are not computational. In this paper, intended for an interdisciplinary audience, we discuss data models for representing organism traits in a computable format. Increasing acceptance of a data model for traits will greatly increase the pool of available data for studying the dynamic processes that determine trait expression. We hope that explaining these data models in a straightforward way and articulating their potential for accelerating discovery will increase adoption of this promising data standard.},

Most of the natural sciences have caches of analogue historical data that would add significantly to our understanding of the evolution of the objects in question, if only the information in those data were readily accessible in modern electronic formats. Unfortunately, many of those analogue data are in precarious physical condition and only very few have been digitized. We review briefly the global situation regarding the status of those ``data at risk'', and suggest strategies that will ensure the preservation of the information that they contain, making it readily and easily accessible in the public domain for use in specific scientific research, disaster risk assessment, or citizen science projects.},

The data is accessible via TreatmentBank and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) and it is continually harvested and reused by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI). This data was processed, enhanced and liberated by the Plazi workflow, which involves a dedicated infrastructure including a desktop application (GoldenGate Imagine) that converts portable document format files (PDF) to a dedicated open compressed file format (Image Markup File (IMF)){\^A} that is responsible for the data enhancement. To enhance the data contained in the publications, including the biological interactions, a series of standards and vocabularies are used. To the exception of TaxPub, which is a taxonomic specific extension of the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS), all other used vocabulary were previously proposed. This goes along with Plazi{\^a} mission to reuse standards unless they are not available. The following standards of vocabularies are used: Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS){\^A} to model article metadata information on Plazi{\^a} XMLs; Darwin Core for taxonomic ranks and materials citation related data; Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO); Relations Ontology for biological interactions between organisms. The latter two are also used in the custom metadata in the Biodiversity Literature Repository at Zenodo.In this presentation we will provide an overview of the different types of data followed by the standards or vocabularies applied for every and each one of them and their parts. The goal is to provide the context on how the data liberated by Plazi is described, which is extensively reused by third-party applications such as GBIF or GloBI. The use of the standards allows fully automated, daily data ingests by GBIF.{\^A}},

@article{10.3897/rio.6.e58030,
	abstract = {We describe an effective approach to automated text digitisation with respect to natural history specimen labels. These labels contain much useful data about the specimen including its collector, country of origin, and collection date. Our approach to automatically extracting these data takes the form of a pipeline. Recommendations are made for the pipeline's component parts based on state-of-the-art technologies.Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used to digitise text on images of specimens. However, recognising text quickly and accurately from these images can be a challenge for OCR. We show that OCR performance can be improved by prior segmentation of specimen images into their component parts. This ensures that only text-bearing labels are submitted for OCR processing as opposed to whole specimen images, which inevitably contain non-textual information that may lead to false positive readings. In our testing Tesseract OCR version 4.0.0 offers promising text recognition accuracy with segmented images.Not all the text on specimen labels is printed. Handwritten text varies much more and does not conform to standard shapes and sizes of individual characters, which poses an additional challenge for OCR. Recently, deep learning has allowed for significant advances in this area. Google's Cloud Vision, which is based on deep learning, is trained on large-scale datasets, and is shown to be quite adept at this task. This may take us some way towards negating the need for humans to routinely transcribe handwritten text.Determining the countries and collectors of specimens has been the goal of previous automated text digitisation research activities. Our approach also focuses on these two pieces of information. An area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) known as Named Entity Recognition (NER) has matured enough to semi-automate this task. Our experiments demonstrated that existing approaches can accurately recognise location and person names within the text extracted from segmented images via Tesseract version 4.0.0.We have highlighted the main recommendations for potential pipeline components. The paper also provides guidance on selecting appropriate software solutions. These include automatic language identification, terminology extraction, and integrating all pipeline components into a scientific workflow to automate the overall digitisation process.},

	abstract = {A vast amount of biodiversity data is reported in the primary taxonomic literature. In the past, we have demonstrated the use of semantic enhancement to extract data from taxonomic literature and make it available to a network of databases (Miller et al. 2015). For technical reasons, semantic enhancement of taxonomic literature is most efficient when customized according to the format of a particular journal. This journal-based approach captures and disseminates data on whatever taxa happen to be published therein. But if we want to extract all treatments on a particular taxon of interest, these are likely to be spread across multiple journals. Fortunately, the GoldenGATE Imagine document editor (Sautter 2019) is flexible enough to parse most taxonomic literature. Tyrannosaurus rex is an iconic dinosaur with broad public appeal, as well as the subject of more than a century of scholarship. The Naturalis Biodiversity Center recently acquired a specimen that has become a major attraction in the public exhibit space. For most species on earth, the primary taxonomic literature contains nearly everything that is known about it. Every described species on earth is the subject of one or more taxonomic treatments. A taxon-based approach to semantic enhancement can mobilize all this knowledge using the network of databases and resources that comprise the modern biodiversity informatics infrastructure. When a particular species is of special interest, a taxon-based approach to semantic enhancement can be a powerful tool for scholarship and communication. In light of this, we resolved to semantically enhance all taxonomic treatments on T. rex. Our objective was to make these treatments and associated data available for the broad range of stakeholders who might have an interest in this animal, including professional paleontologists, the curious public, and museum exhibits and public communications personnel. Among the routine parsing and data sharing activities in the Plazi workflow (Agosti and Egloff 2009), taxonomic treatments, as well as cited figures, are deposited in the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR), and occurrence records are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Treatment citations were enhanced with hyperlinks to the cited treatment on TreatmentBank, and specimen citations were linked to their entries on public facing collections databases. We used the OpenBiodiv biodiversity knowledge graph{\^A} (Senderov et al. 2017) to discover other taxa mentioned together with T. rex,{\^A} and to create a timeline of T. rex research to evaluate the impact of individual researchers and specimen repositories to T. rex research.{\^A} We contributed treatment{\^A} links to WikiData, and queried{\^A} WikiData to discover identifiers to different platforms holding data about T. rex.{\^A} We used{\^A} bloodhound-tracker.net to disambiguate human agents, like collectors, identifiers, and authors.{\^A} We evaluate the adequacy of the fields currently available to extract data from taxonomic treatments, and make recommendations for future standards.},

Historical data provide a means of regaining that information, but they still are not commonly applied in marine conservation and management. Omission of relevant historical information typically results in assessments of conservation status that are more optimistic, recovery targets that are lower, and fisheries quotas that are higher than if long-term data were considered. Here, we review data and methods that can be used to estimate historical baselines for marine species including bony fishes, sharks, turtles, and mammals, demonstrate how baselines used in management change when historical data are included, and provide specific examples of how data from the past can be applied in management and conservation including extinction risk assessment, recovery target setting, and management of data-poor fisheries.

@article{kearney_its_2019,
	abstract = {The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is a global consortium of over 460 contributors who have specifically chosen the BHL as the online platform to host their digitised biodiversity heritage literature. In 2018, staff from BHL Australia (a project funded by the Atlas of Living Australia and hosted by Museums Victoria) travelled across the Tasman Sea to work with the Auckland War Memorial Museum (T{\=a}maki Paenga Hira) to start a new branch of the BHL -- BHL New Zealand.
The Auckland War Memorial Museum has a novel approach when it comes to its own online content. They believe that the best way to amplify their collections is not via their own website, but via external collaborations. Acknowledging that their own website cannot best serve the many different types of content they curate and create, they seek the external platforms that can -- platforms that have the specific functionality required to make each type of content findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and that will reach and impact the greatest audience.
When the Auckland Museum was seeking the best platform for their biodiversity heritage literature, they were attracted by the BHL's functionality (such as Full Text Search, Optical Character Recognition and Global Names Recognition and Discovery); the extended discoverability and interoperability enabled via the BHL's partnerships (such as with the Encyclopedia of Life, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities); and BHL's massive audience.
However, the BHL is not the only platform hosting biodiversity heritage literature. Commercial publishers are rapidly uploading the back issues of the journals they host. There are now thousands of out-of-copyright journal articles on websites such as Wiley Online Library and Taylor \& Francis Online. Historic literature is not the primary focus for these publishers, but the functionality they provide for journal articles has brought the historic publications they host into the modern linked network of scholarly research. Every article on their websites, whether it was published 200 years ago or today, receives a Digital Object Identifier (a DOI).
A DOI is a unique permanent identifier assigned to a piece of online content (usually) at the time of its publication -- a persistent link that should be included in every citation of that piece of content. In an ideal world, the DOI system would enable readers to link from article to article in a never-ending trail of knowledge. However, a significant proportion of our historic literature still sits outside this linked network, representing dead ends (or at least annoying setbacks) in the quest for information. The other invaluable benefit of DOIs is that they provide citation metrics, allowing authors, publishers and institutions to track the use and impact of their publications.
The historic literature is the foundation upon which our understanding of biodiversity is based. It is critical that this foundation is easily discoverable, openly accessible, persistently linkable and unambiguously trackable. The BHL -- the world's largest online library of biodiversity heritage literature -- has an enormous role to play in ensuring that this literature is brought into the DOI system, and that publishers and researchers continue to have the option of an online platform that not only provides the best functionality for biodiversity heritage literature, but also open access to it.},

	abstract = {Taxonomic literature contains information about virtually ever known species on Earth. In many cases, all that is known about a taxon is contained in this kind of literature, particularly for the most diverse and understudied groups. Taxonomic publications in the aggregate have documented a vast amount of specimen data. Among other things, these data constitute evidence of the existence of a particular taxon within a spatial and temporal context. When knowledge about a particular taxonomic group is rudimentary, investigators motivated to contribute new knowledge can use legacy records to guide them in their search for new specimens in the field. However, these legacy data are in the form of unstructured text, making it difficult to extract and analyze without a human interpreter. Here, we used a combination of semi-automatic tools to extract and categorize specimen data from taxonomic literature of one family of ground spiders (Liocranidae). We tested the application of these data on fieldwork optimization, using the relative abundance of adult specimens reported in literature as a proxy to find the best times and places for collecting the species (Teutamus politus) and its relatives (Teutamus group, TG) within Southeast Asia. Based on these analyses we decided to collect in three provinces in Thailand during the months of June and August. With our approach, we were able to collect more specimens of T. politus (188 specimens, 95 adults) than all the previous records in literature combined (102 specimens). Our approach was also effective for sampling other representatives of the TG, yielding at least one representative of every TG genus previously reported for Thailand. In total, our samples contributed 231 specimens (134 adults) to the 351 specimens previously reported in the literature for this country. Our results exemplify one application of mined literature data that allows investigators to more efficiently allocate effort and resources for the study of neglected, endangered, or interesting taxa and geographic areas. Furthermore, the integrative workflow demonstrated here shares specimen data with global online resources like Plazi and GBIF, meaning that others can freely reuse these data and contribute to them in the future. The contributions of the present study represent an increase of more than 35\% on the taxonomic coverage of the TG in GBIF based on the number of species. Also, our extracted data represents 72\% of the occurrences now available through GBIF for the TG and more than 85\% of occurrences of T. politus. Taxonomic literature is a key source of undigitized biodiversity data for taxonomic groups that are underrepresented in the current biodiversity data sphere. Mobilizing these data is key to understanding and protecting some of the less well-known domains of biodiversity.},

To this end, a workshop was organised in the Hellenic Center for Marine Research Crete (HCMR), Heraklion Crete, (8--9 June 2015) to assess possible mechanisms and guideCorrespondinglines to mobilise legacy biodiversity data. Workshop participants were data managers who actually implement data archaeology and rescue activities, as well as external experts in data mobilisation and data publication. In particular, current problems associated with manual extraction of occurrence data from legacy literature were reviewed, tools and mechanisms which could support a semi-automated process of data extraction were explored and the re-publication of the data, including incentives for data curators and scientists were reflected upon.},

	abstract = {BIOfid is a specialized information service currently being developed to mobilize biodiversity data dormant in printed historical and modern literature and to offer a platform for open access journals on the science of biodiversity. Our team of librarians, computer scientists and biologists produce high-quality text digitizations, develop new text-mining tools and generate detailed ontologies enabling semantic text analysis and semantic search by means of user-specific queries. In a pilot project we focus on German publications on the distribution and ecology of vascular plants, birds, moths and butterflies extending back to the Linnaeus period about 250 years ago. The three organism groups have been selected according to current demands of the relevant research community in Germany. The text corpus defined for this purpose comprises over 400 volumes with more than 100,000 pages to be digitized and will be complemented by journals from other digitization projects, copyright-free and project-related literature. With TextImager (Natural Language Processing \&amp; Text Visualization) and TextAnnotator (Discourse Semantic Annotation) we have already extended and launched tools that focus on the text-analytical section of our project. Furthermore, taxonomic and anatomical ontologies elaborated by us for the taxa prioritized by the project's target group - German institutions and scientists active in biodiversity research - are constantly improved and expanded to maximize scientific data output. Our poster describes the general workflow of our project ranging from literature acquisition via software development, to data availability on the BIOfid web portal (http://biofid.de/), and the implementation into existing platforms which serve to promote global accessibility of biodiversity data.},

@article{stuart-smith_thermal_2015,
	abstract = {A critical assumption underlying projections of biodiversity change associated with global warming is that ecological communities comprise balanced mixes of warm-affinity and cool-affinity species which, on average, approximate local environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, here we find that most shallow water marine species occupy broad thermal distributions that are aggregated in either temperate or tropical realms. These distributional trends result in ocean-scale spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming, and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as inferred from present-day species' distributional ranges, outweighs spatial variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species loss.},

@article{thessen_automated_2018,
	abstract = {The cTAKES package (using the ClearTK Natural Language Processing toolkit Bethard et al. 2014, http://cleartk.github.io/cleartk/) has been successfully used to automatically read clinical notes in the medical field (Albright et al. 2013, Styler et al. 2014). It is used on a daily basis to automatically process clinical notes and extract relevant information by dozens of medical institutions. ClearEarth is a collaborative project that brings together computational linguistics and domain scientists to port Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules trained on the same types of linguistic annotation to the fields of geology, cryology, and ecology. The goal for ClearEarth in the ecology domain is the extraction of ecologically-relevant terms, including eco-phenotypic traits from text and the assignment of those traits to taxa. Four annotators used Anafora (an annotation software; https://github.com/weitechen/anafora) to mark seven entity types (biotic, aggregate, abiotic, locality, quality, unit, value) and six reciprocal property types (synonym of/has synonym, part of/has part, subtype/supertype) in 133 documents from primarily Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Wikipedia according to project guidelines (https://github.com/ClearEarthProject/AnnotationGuidelines). Inter-annotator agreement ranged from 43\% to 90\%. Performance of ClearEarth on identifying named entities in biology text overall was good (precision: 85.56\%; recall: 71.57\%). The named entities with the best performance were organisms and their parts/products (biotic entities - precision: 72.09\%; recall: 54.17\%) and systems and environments (aggregate entities - precision: 79.23\%; recall: 75.34\%). Terms and their relationships extracted by ClearEarth can be embedded in the new ecocore ontology after vetting (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ecocore.html). This project enables use of advanced industry and research software within natural sciences for downstream operations such as data discovery, assessment, and analysis. In addition, ClearEarth uses the NLP results to generate domain-specific ontologies and other semantic resources.},

@article{driller_fast_2020,
	abstract = {The storage of data in public repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is nowadays stipulated in the policies of many publishers in order to facilitate data replication or proliferation. Species occurrence records contained in legacy printed literature are no exception to this. The extent of their digital and machine-readable availability, however, is still far from matching the existing data volume (Thessen and Parr 2014). But precisely these data are becoming more and more relevant to the investigation of ongoing loss of biodiversity. In order to extract species occurrence records at a larger scale from available publications, one has to apply specialised text mining tools. However, such tools are in short supply especially for scientific literature in the German language.
            
              The Specialised Information Service Biodiversity Research*1 BIOfid (Koch et al. 2017) aims at reducing this desideratum,
              inter alia
              , by preparing a searchable text corpus semantically enriched by a new kind of multi-label annotation. For this purpose, we feed manual annotations into automatic, machine-learning annotators. This mixture of automatic and manual methods is needed, because BIOfid approaches a new application area with respect to language (mainly German of the 19th century), text type (biological reports), and linguistic focus (technical and everyday language).
            
            
              We will present current results of the performance of BIOfid's semantic search engine and the application of independent natural language processing (NLP) tools. Most of these are freely available online, such as
              TextImager
              
              (Hemati et al. 2016). We will show how
              TextImager
              is tied into the BIOfid pipeline and how it is made scalable (e.g. extendible by further modules) and usable on different systems (docker containers).
            
            
              Further, we will provide a short introduction to generating machine-learning training data using
              TextAnnotator
              (Abrami et al. 2019) for multi-label annotation. Annotation reproducibility can be assessed by the implementation of inter-annotator agreement methods (Abrami et al. 2020). Beyond taxon recognition and entity linking, we place particular emphasis on location and time information. For this purpose, our annotation tag-set combines general categories and biology-specific categories (including taxonomic names) with location and time ontologies. The application of the annotation categories is regimented by annotation guidelines (L{\"u}cking et al. 2020). Within the next years, our work deliverable will be a semantically accessible and data-extractable text corpus of around two million pages. In this way, BIOfid is creating a new valuable resource that expands our knowledge of biodiversity and its determinants.},

@article{pafilis_extract_2017,
	abstract = {Data curation is a process occurring in many aspects of biodiversity research, e.g. in digitization of specimen collections and extraction of species occurrences from the legacy literature. Data curation is always characterized by being time demanding and tedious. Gathering information on species and exposing it via search interfaces could be facilitated once phrases of interest have been recognized and the mentioned entities have been linked to community resources.
  A curator can benefit from interactive systems that highlight biological entities in a document, indicating sections of interest, and map entities to corresponding database records/ontology terms, and offering an easy mechanism for extracting annotations in a structured form.
  EXTRACT (https://extract.hcmr.gr, Pafilis et al. 2016) is a system that aims to address the above challenges. Its web User Interface is a bookmarklet that identifies genes/proteins, chemical compounds, organisms, environments, tissues, diseases, phenotypes and Gene Ontology terms mentioned in a web page and maps them to their corresponding database, ontology, and taxonomy entries. Two modes of operation are supported: a. extraction of biological entities mentioned in user-selected piece of text, and b. full-page tagging. To easily collect extracted annotations, e.g. for use in an Excel spreadsheet, direct Copy to clipboard and Save to file (tab-delimited) are supported.
  EXTRACT was originally developed specifically to facilitate metagenomic sample record annotation (Pafilis et al. 2016). As such it participated in the BioCreative V interactive annotation task. EXTRACT achieved one of the top scores in terms of usability and was evaluated to accelerate curation by 15--25\% (Wang et al. 2016).
  The latest version of EXTRACT (2.0, Pafilis et al. 2017) serves a much broader audience involving both biomedicine and biodiversity researchers and thus recognizes a wide range of entity types from many community resources:
  
    Organisms (NCBI Taxonomy,  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) 
    Environments (Environment Ontology, Buttigieg et al. 2016)
    Diseases and phenotypes (Disease Ontology, Kibbe et al. 2014, and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Smith and Eppig 2012)

  In addition to curators benefitting from such a tool, knowledge-base developers can easily integrate the EXTRACT functionality into their own systems. To this end, we provide a robust and thoroughly documented Application Programming Interface (https://extract.hcmr.gr, FAQ section). EXTRACT can thus serve as a building block in large knowledge management pipelines, which also perform downstream tasks such as statistical entity association and association extraction, knowledge graph generation presenting the extracted associations, document indexing and information retrieval.
  Such tasks lie at the core of the workshop this abstract has been submitted to and are pertinent to the TDWG 2017 theme, which is dedicated to the integration of species occurrence, gene, phenotype, and environment associations.},

@article{fortibuoni_coding_2010,
	abstract = {The understanding of fish communities' changes over the past centuries has important implications for conservation policy and marine resource management. However, reconstructing these changes is difficult because information on marine communities before the second half of the 20th century is, in most cases, anecdotal and merely qualitative. Therefore, historical qualitative records and modern quantitative data are not directly comparable, and their integration for long-term analyses is not straightforward. We developed a methodology that allows the coding of qualitative information provided by early naturalists into semi-quantitative information through an intercalibration with landing proportions. This approach allowed us to reconstruct and quantitatively analyze a 200-year-long time series of fish community structure indicators in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Our analysis provides evidence of long-term changes in fish community structure, including the decline of Chondrichthyes, large-sized and late-maturing species. This work highlights the importance of broadening the time-frame through which we look at marine ecosystem changes and provides a methodology to exploit, in a quantitative framework, historical qualitative sources. To the purpose, naturalists' eyewitness accounts proved to be useful for extending the analysis on fish community back in the past, well before the onset of field-based monitoring programs.},
